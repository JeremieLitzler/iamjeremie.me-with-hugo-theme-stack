&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Don’t burry woodchip&lt;/p>&lt;p>Since Charles is the no-dig advocate, he doesn’t bury the woodchips and he warms us that if you dig and burry the woodchips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They will suck the nitrogen out of the rooting zone and it will deprive your plants and vegetables of what they need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the surface, it’s fine because the plants and vegetables will set their root under the woodchips.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>After breaking down a pile of woodchip compost from a bioreactor, you get the following.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Later in the vlog, Charles explains more about the pipes in the bioreactor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s supposed to help maintaining air in the heap. But is it necessary?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woodchip by its natural structure will allow air to be present, hence why we can add it to the compost heap to give the greener material &lt;em>a breath&lt;/em> and prevent sludge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that other bioreactor, Charles added chicken manure and the temperature is consequently higher than the uncovered pile described below.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With fresh fragmented fresh wood (which is what Charles presented, not the dry woodchips), you will get some activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, there is no problem with conifer wood, in Charles’s experience. He feels that the pH level with that kind of wood, once well decomposed, isn’t an issue. I have found that to be true as well for the few years I used them from a source of Douglas wood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, with a pile, you will need to water it if you don’t get enough rain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more green the material you get in the woodchip, the faster they will decompose. It isn’t more true in the summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles used a lawnmower to the breakdown of the woodchips after 4–6 months of winter decomposing.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Green material will decompose faster than the wood pieces, and after 9 months, Charles found out that there are a lot of woodchips left.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I say &lt;em>regular&lt;/em> woodchips, it means with no green, in particular the ones you can get in the sawmill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It decomposes slower, but it will provide some useful materials with time.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="patience-is-key">Patience is key&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can get the woodchip to a pure humus state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you can use water and moisture to speed up the process, you will need significantly more time to decompose woodchips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you reach the humus state, then you have a very good addition for the garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>From what I saw, it seems that the bioreactor setup speed up the decomposition, very likely because you have got a managed structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a pile lying on the ground, you can’t keep the moisture has easily. And watering the pile may use more water than the bioreactor contained environment.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-woodchips">How to use woodchips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles uses woodchips in 4 ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>pathways&lt;/li>
&lt;li>woody material for compost heap (when it’s a few months old and already decomposing)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>burning it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>filling a bed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="pathways">Pathways&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Woodchips on pathways has several advantages :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it keeps your boots clean&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it will eventually provide a source of food for your plants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it helps to keep the soil firm, not compact.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="filling-a-bed-with-2-year-old-woodchips">Filling a bed with 2-year-old woodchips&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To finish, how does it compare to grow vegetables in 2-year-old woodchips “&lt;em>compost&lt;/em>” to regular homemade compost?&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="Big pieces of wood and slugs" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Big pieces of wood and slugs&lt;/p>&lt;p>Be careful of the large wood piece that can shelter slugs…&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What Charles experienced was a very poor start, with a lot of yellow leaves for 6 weeks.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 6 weeks, Charles thinks that the roots got through the layer of woodchips and it ended to be successful, even if less productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Try it yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Try to get the smallest sized woodchips, if you can. But it’s hard to &lt;em>choose&lt;/em> what you get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, use the lawnmower technique.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some more tips from Huw Richards about compost, by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-01/some-more-tips-about-compost-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-01/some-more-tips-about-compost-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="composting-tips">Composting tips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’ll put here only what Huw hasn’t already shared in more recent vlogs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One tip that he hasn’t talked about a lot regarding nitrogen rich material: it’s urine. Of course, you will need to dilute it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At least, Huw is consistent between 2013 and 2022: he has been consistently saying to put 1 part green for 2 parts brown material in the compost bin. Also, he suggests again not to compost meat and dairy to keep the rats away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, it isn’t a good idea to compost pet manure, from cats and dogs, for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>First, I find that they really stink&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Second, Huw mentioned they contain microorganisms that you don’t want because of the diet of those pets (most carnivores).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>However, mostly vegetarian pets like guinea pigs and chicken can work fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The interesting fact is that the tip about to keep the compost bin warm. It makes me think of the tip from &lt;a href="../../../tag/charles-dowding">Charles Dowding&lt;/a>. He builds his compost bin fully closed on the side.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I have made 2 compost bins lately and I did make them fully closed, making sure to layer well the green and the brown to always oxygen to stay present.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>One thing he insists on is to keep too much rain away in the compost. Charles Dowding recommends the same. I therefore made some tops for my compost bins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, similarly to Charles Dowding: he recommends to ask around to gather more nitrogen-rich material, as it will be the resource that you will struggle to obtain in sufficient quantity (unless, you have a huge lawn 😅).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-pallet-compost">Building pallet compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw is building his compost bins from pallets without making sure the sides are full. See above for the model I’ve made.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="adding-weeds-in-the-compost">Adding weeds in the compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can, but as long as the weeds haven’t gone to seed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can put the weeds with seeds if you can build up a compost bin with a lot of heat. Above 55 °C, the seeds won’t survive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sand-in-compost">Sand in compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The advantage of sand would be to help with:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>drainage on clay soil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>root vegetables to grow nice and big because of the smooth texture.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>However, a soil that drains too much means a poorer water retention, which means you will need to water more often.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So maybe, I’d suggest to use it on the first 10 cm max, but always mixed with soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw didn’t put much anyways.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>1 part of green (coffee ground, grass clippings)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the vlog, a friend of Huw suggests you need air to feed the material degrading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Charles Dowding said that as long as the compost heap remains moist but not wet, there will still be air in the material, coming from the way you pile up the material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Piling up the material is done in layers and the brown layers allow air in the pile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you live in a dry area, especially in summer, you will want to have a water source available to keep the compost moist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The moisture is what will keep the living organisms breaking down the material of the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my area, 1000 L of compost cost 150 euros if purchased in bags.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could get compost in bulk (26 euros for 2000 L organic-graded compost), but I&amp;rsquo;d need to rent a truck which is over 3 times the price of the compost…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two methods to get the compost hotter:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>building a 0.7 meter cube compost heap&lt;/li>
&lt;li>turning the compost&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-large-compost-heap">Why a large compost heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It does retain the moisture better, therefore, the micro-organisms&amp;rsquo; activity is increased.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, it will also consume more water as heat in a compost pile means life and life needs water, no matter the form or size.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-turning-really-worth-it">Is turning really worth it&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw suggests that the second way to turn the compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mixing the pile kickstarts the microbial activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I’m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d want to spend the energy turning the compost often just to keep the pile hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles Dowding&amp;rsquo;s method appeals to me more because you focus your energy to find more material, especially the green materials, to build up the compost pile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more green material you add, the more heat you can get and therefore, the faster you will have compost available.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What is true is the following: whether you turn the compost pile or not, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to compact your compost pile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Air is one of the key ingredients to make compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-third-way">A third way&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I said in my personal note, adding more nitrogen will increase heat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nitrogen means more green material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, what isn&amp;rsquo;t explained in the vlog is how do you get enough green material?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For that, I invite you to &lt;a href="../../../tag/compost/">read more on the topic of composting&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can find pallets for free at the back of supermarkets, or you could ask your neighbors: maybe one works where they have pallets to throw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, either:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>use a string to tie the bottom and top of each pallet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>use a wire if you want the structure to last. It would be the only purchase if you find free pallets.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A setup like this required 12 pallets.&lt;/p>

Let’s see what tips Huw has to share.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt6mIoKK6wE">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can call a garden “a garden” if you don’t make your compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost is turning your waster into soil food.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-location-of-the-compost-bin">The location of the compost bin&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ideally, it needs to be in a corner and it needs to be in the share.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It needs to be close enough to the source of materials you will put in the bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, set your bin high up so you don’t have to climb &lt;em>a hill&lt;/em> to your garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-the-compost-bin">Building the compost bin&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many designs, but to my opinion, use pallets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re a family and don’t run a farm, don’t buy anything else other than screw or nails and a bit of wire. Look at &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/how-to-make-a-compost-bin-from-pallets-huw-richards/">this article detailing the process&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re running a farm, then this article won’t explain how to build compost bins optimized for large-scale operations. However, have a read of &lt;a href="../../../tag/charles-dowding/">the notes I took so far on the compost topic by Charles Dowding&lt;/a>. He runs a little business and he has a large 6-heap structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-materials">What materials&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s again simple. You have green material and brown material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw lists the most common greens and browns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Greens:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Horse and cow manure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rabbit and Guinea Pig droppings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Used coffee ground&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kitchen vegetable scraps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Garden weeds which haven’t flowered&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grass clippings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spent brewery grains&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Browns:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Autumn leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shredded paper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Newspaper and cardboard&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dried grass&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-ratio-of-brown-and-green">What ratio of brown and green&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw makes it simple once more, despite the numerous recipes out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You want to simple mix 2 portions of brown with 1 portion of green.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you empty the material in the following order: brown over green.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will then build up a &lt;em>lasania&lt;/em> (e.g., layers) compost heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method is called &lt;em>slow composting&lt;/em> because the heat is what speed up the composting process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, you need a lot more green materials in general and, trust me, it’s difficult to get plenty of material for hot compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problems-and-troubleshooting">Problems and troubleshooting&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Lack of nitrogen: if the compost takes over 12 months to be ready, add some more manure or greens.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Smell: if you put too much nitrogen, the heap might stink. You can easily solve that with an addition of a brown material.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Compost too wet: with too much water in the compost, the bacteria don’t thrive as well as if it was just moist. You can solve that with laying cardboard on top of the compost pile.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ideas-to-get-more-material-to-put-on-the-compost-pile">Ideas to get more material to put on the compost pile&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Ask your family, friends and neighbors to give away their compostable wastes by providing them with a container&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask your local coffee place to collect coffee grounds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask your local shops to spare the cardboard boxes that you can easily use in your garden and on the compost bin.&lt;/li>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The potting bench includes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A working area made of a few wood planks where you can empty the compost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A table where you will put your tools
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Module trays of various sizes (deep-rooted for peas and beans, or shallower trays for general-purpose seeds)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Labels made from recycled materials&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">How to make your labels&lt;/p>&lt;p>Huw mentioned yogurt pots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use the wood of an old crate.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A box for unfinished seed packets
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It’s very rare to sow a full packet of seeds, so keep those in a sturdy box, away from the humidity and sun.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Seed or multi-purpose compost" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Seed or multi-purpose compost&lt;/p>&lt;p>Huw had found that seed compost is too expensive for the actual benefits and multi-purpose compost does a good job for propagation.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="where-to-put-the-seed-trays">Where to put the seed trays&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One limitation of growing seedlings is a lack of space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The simple trick is to use shelves to rest the trays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have mice problem, do like Huw: set your most precious or less attractive-to-mouse seedlings higher!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="watering-seedlings">Watering seedlings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s a good idea to have a small watering can for fragile seedlings like lettuce.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or if you’re like me, I use a GLORIA Hobby 100 Pressure Sprayer (available &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3HDhcaX">in France&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3PtT1xK">in the UK&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3HGzSH5">in the US&lt;/a>, this brand doesn’t seem to be available.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s quite handy as you can adjust the spray finely. Also, it’s sturdier than a bigger version sprayer (not the same brand) of 5 liters capacity. It broke twice after a year :( So I recommend a 1 liter like this Gloria model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re sowing on a warm month, after you have sown the seeds and watered the tray, cover it with a brown cardboard to retain the moisture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That way the seeds will germinate better (especially true for carrots as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jamesprigioni/search?query=carrots">James Prigioni shared&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to check daily until you see the seedlings come out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you will need an area where you can take out your seedlings out to water them. On the shelves, it’s often not practical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/a-pallet-structure-for-watering-seedling.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="A pallet structure for watering seedling"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The height is also ideal with standard 80 cm pallets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Checkout &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXR92xHfgic&amp;amp;t=988s">Charles Dowding’s vlogs&lt;/a> where he tells us more about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparing-the-trays">Preparing the trays&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The steps are simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fill the trays with compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press down with your fingers on the compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill the trays with some more compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water the tray on the ground if it’s quite dry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create some holes where you will sow the seeds in each module&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sow enough seeds. See &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/early-summer-2018-at-homeacres-charles-dowding/#what-can-you-sow-in-the-beginning-of-june-in-the-uk">this article from a vlog of Charles Dowding&lt;/a> for a few examples.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gently fill the holes with some more compost&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Why before sowing" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Why before sowing&lt;/p>&lt;p>Huw likes to do this because once the seed is in the module, the water can displace it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you won’t need to water again after sowing if the weather is overcast.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="cold-frame">Cold frame&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A cold frame is a structure that you have outside with a glass top, like an old window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s the final stage to prepare the seedlings to acclimate to the lower temperatures, yet with no frost risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw mentioned it rather quickly at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have got a lot of old wooden windows that I’d like to use to build either a cold frame or a tiny greenhouse.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I found the following interesting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>With Huw’s build or mine, you don’t need to dig the corners in the ground. The bin simply rests on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Just like Huw, I prefer screws rather than nails.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you do use screws, maybe, I will go a bit further, use stainless steel screws, so that, if you take the bin apart, they won’t break on you from rusting.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Setup a &lt;em>tool share&lt;/em> with your neighborhood&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>List the tools each person has&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Share the tools when needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7iu4xgSu1Y">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s important to prioritize making your own compost the following tips are short-term adjustments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you aren’t making enough compost, by the end of the article, you will have an action plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="compost-levels">Compost levels&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first tip is to mix compost and top soil together to optimize the use of compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using 1 part good compost and 3 to 4 parts top soil is a good start.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mulching">Mulching&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you don’t have enough compost, mulching with alternatives happens to be a solution:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>woodchip&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dead leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="About perennial plants" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">About perennial plants&lt;/p>&lt;p>They aren’t super nutrient hungry plants for using woodchips will suffice them.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="grass-clippings">Grass clippings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s the most underutilized material and you must get grass that wasn’t sprayed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go ask around your neighborhood and it’s very likely, if you don’t live in the city, that you will find people delighted to give away their grass clippings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The important thing when applying grass clipping is to apply it in thin layers, maximum two to three centimeters, especially in a UK-like climate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Grass clippings can make excellent slug accommodation and your plants won’t like it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, it can form a thick sludge that can smell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to be sure, sprinkling the grass on the soil will be fine. Perform the task in the morning of a sunny and the grass will decompose rather quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Applying grass is easy because it produces a lot and you can sprinkle it once a month.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In wood ash, you will find charcoal that, once broken up, can soak up all the nutrients and provide a slow release of those nutrients to the plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wood ash is high in potassium and phosphorus, both good for plant growth. However it’s missing nitrogen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is when the coffee grounds come into the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The myth about coffee ground being too acid isn’t a reality, according to Huw (others like &lt;a href="../../tag/charles-dowding/">Charles Dowding&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, when you brew the coffee, a lot of the acidity goes away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, you mix those two ingredients and you apply around the plants a sprinkle of the mix once a month. It doesn’t need to be too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If possible, do it right before some rain or watering. The water you will help the mix dissolve and go down the plant’s roots.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Comfrey is a must-have for the gardener&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do have half a dozen plants that I’m starting to propagate. The plant provides a huge quantity of nutrient-rich leaves. It can replace animal manure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advantages of comfrey are numerous:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Letting comfrey flower is a fantastic bee restaurant.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It’s a dynamic accumulator: its long tap root brings up a lot of the minerals in the soil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It’s a compost activator&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is great for mulching beds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="liquid-feed">Liquid feed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The advantage of liquid feed is that it provides soluble nutrients to the plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using comfrey again, you make your own within 2 or 3 weeks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is huge not to rely on buying compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sacrifice some of you growing space to make your own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest challenge is to gather material. I find this very true and it requires a lot of ingenuity to find sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One key advice I’d give is to look close to you. You will be surprised about how much your neighborhood has to offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bulk-compost">Bulk compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If it is available in your area and if it is approved for organic gardening, go for it. For Huw, it cost £40 per ton.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The closest I can get is 26 euros per ton, but I need to rent a truck to bring it home, so in the end, it cost 115 euros per ton&amp;hellip; I’m still very hesitant at the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can maybe purchase it as a group, hence lowering the cost. In my case, I can have it delivered but I will need a rather big storage area because they only deliver a minimum of 10 tons!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Art of Lazy Composting or how to Make High-Quality Compost the Simple Way, by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/the-art-of-lazy-composting-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/the-art-of-lazy-composting-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-12-06-the-art-of-lazy-title-overlaying-someone-handling-fennel.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Art of Lazy Composting or how to Make High-Quality Compost the Simple Way, by Huw Richards" />&lt;p>Sometimes, we think of making compost as a complex process, but, in reality, it’s easy to produce high-quality compost.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="you-need-bins-of-1-meter-long">You need bins of 1 meter long&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Why? It isn’t going to warm up as easily as in a dalek size bin. It needs a larger size bin to be able to build up the warmth.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will typically add:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>green material: grass, vegetable waste, coffee ground…&lt;/li>
&lt;li>brown material: dead leaves, wood, cardboard…&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I have found that mixing grass clippings with wood dust helps build a thin compost and helps to avoid the sludge.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="ratio-of-green-and-brown">Ratio of green and brown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw tries to go for a 1 part green for 2 parts brown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, with lazy composting, he doesn’t overthink it. &lt;strong>But you will need to &lt;em>follow one key rule&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="you-need-diversity">You need diversity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Two or three ingredients aren’t enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more you add diverse sources of material, the more balance the compost will be in terms of pH and nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-a-bin-is-full">When a bin is full&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The only thing to do: press on the material to compact it a little.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put on some boots, climb in the bin and jump!&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="Jumping in the compost bin" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Jumping in the compost bin&lt;/p>&lt;p>Don’t do it if you didn’t build a strong structure 🤣&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Finally, cover the compost with cardboard to keep some rainfall off the compost pile. You want moisture but you don’t have anaerobic environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-is-lazy-compost-ready">When is lazy compost ready&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It will take longer, because it doesn’t get as hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead, two to three months, it will take between six and eight months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw uses the technique of smelling the compost: if it smells like the forest floor, then it’s ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you can apply it to the beds as a cover for winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-rats">What about rats&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will get rats if you put in cooked food, diaries and bread in the compost bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And wouldn’t you prefer having them in the compost bin or your food storage?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-many-compost-bins">How many compost bins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Three bins appears to be a good target:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>one is usable for the garden&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one is full and is starting to break down&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one is being filled&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Therefore you will have compost available most of the time!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>These 8 Free Ingredients Will Bulk Out Your Compost Bins, by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/8-free-ingredients-will-bulk-out-compost-bins-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/8-free-ingredients-will-bulk-out-compost-bins-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-12-02-sheep-wool-as-a-compostable-material.jpg" alt="Featured image of post These 8 Free Ingredients Will Bulk Out Your Compost Bins, by Huw Richards" />&lt;p>A gardener can’t have too much compost and in fact you may not be able to create enough.

&lt;p>For example, old nettle stems work well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will provide enough oxygen at the base and it’s key to help the microbes thrive and develop to break down the material in the compost.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I’m currently gathering a lot of them. So far in early December 2022, I harvested 8 cube meters of dead leaves in various sizes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You may wonder:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How much do I put of this? How do I put of that?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To keep it, simple, Huw suggests to mix up the ingredients with a fork.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you can apply each ingredient in layers and if you have 2 ingredients in each category of green and brown material, spread each in several layers so no one is too thick.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="balance-the-green-and-brown-material">Balance the green and brown material&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw uses this ratio: for one bucket of green, he puts one or two buckets of brown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But you don’t need to measure precisely the amount you put in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="invest-in-composting">Invest in composting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Composting is much better than investing in stock markets!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It doesn’t cost anything often except your time and ingenuity to source material around you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It helps you grow better and stronger vegetables that will help you reach more self-sufficiency in food.&lt;/p>

Huw shares a trick to do without.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vAwurGpl-M">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LizZorab/videos">Liz Zorab&lt;/a> inspired Huw with this concept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She uses a lot of woodchips in her garden alleys. After a while, she observed that the woodchips had turned into a dark broken-down material thanks to the traffic in the garden, the rain, the wind and the duck roaming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She then told herself that she could use this woodchip compost in her garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then, you simply fork it from the pathways to the beds right beside it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="woodchip-hybrid-compost">Woodchip hybrid compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw suggests a hybrid solution, using kitchen scraps and other garden waste to create a nitrogen-rich compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="protect-wooden-beds">Protect wooden beds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you go for this technique, you will need to protect the wooden beds with an empty compost bag, for example.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially if you have grass paths, it’s ideal to apply a layer of cardboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It still allows earth contact between the soil life.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="calculate-the-volume-of-compost-it-can-create">Calculate the volume of compost it can create&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Huw’s example, his pathway measures 3 meters long and 55 cm wide. He planned to put a 15 cm layer of material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He would get about 250 liters of compost in the end!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-beneficial-is-it">How beneficial is it&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you have beds like Huw that measure 3 m by 1.2 m and you apply 3 cm of compost, 108 liters of compost. So with one alley, you can deal with the two beds surrounding it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="applying-the-materials">Applying the materials&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>apply a 3 cm layer of woodchips, as the base layer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>throw on top of it any weeds that you find in the nearby beds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add more shredded cardboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add your vegetable waste or comfrey leaves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add kitchen scraps (but add something else on top like leaves or more cardboard) .6. finish with a good soaking if you lack rain.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Walking in the pathways is the first step. Your weight helps to break down.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It will bring enough air to the organisms breaking down the materials.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="trick1-consider-a-_break-year_">Trick 1: Consider a &lt;em>break year&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is a year you don’t put any compost on an area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn’t something you would do to start with, but rather you use this trick down the line after a few years of mulching.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trick2-dedicate-an-area-to-crop-that-doesnt-need-a-lot-of-nutrients">Trick 2: Dedicate an area to crop that doesn’t need a lot of nutrients&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For example, legumes, like filed beans, adapt well to poorer soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trick3-compost-directly-on-the-beds">Trick 3: Compost directly on the beds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you apply compost, you add carbon, nitrogen, microbes and nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But simply said, compost is old plants decomposed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what Huw calls &lt;em>Chop, Move and Drop&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s like &lt;a href="#trick-3-compost-directly-on-the-beds">trick 3&lt;/a>, but, in this case, you need to apply it in a thin layer (2 cm to 3 cm) to avoid rotting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">About slugs&lt;/p>&lt;p>If you have a lot of slugs, use 1 cm layer of grass clippings. Otherwise, they will hide under it and feast on your vegetables.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="trick5-jadam-microbial-solution">Trick 5: JADAM microbial solution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will find the images of the recipe &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5TvNwDeEzU">in this short vlog &lt;em>Do This With Potatoes To BOOST Soil &amp;amp; Plant Health&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and goes as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tools:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a square piece of fabric&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The ingredients:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 small boiled potatoes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a handful of leaf mold&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 g of sea salt&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Instructions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cut the piece of fabric&lt;/li>
&lt;li>smash the potatoes on the fabric&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add the leaf mold&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tie the fabric into a sachet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>put in an opaque container&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pour and knead the sachet with rain water (or soft water)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add the salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mix well&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cover&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After 1 or 4 days, depending on the weather, you will see bubbles creating, which means microbes multiply in the solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To use the solution,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>take 1:20 of the solution mixed with rain water (or soft water).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>apply it to the garden&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It provides:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a big boost to your plants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a kick-start to the microbial activity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and a help to break down the material into your soil.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you apply the solution once a month in the poorest beds, it’s going to make a lot of difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trick6-trench-planting">Trick 6: Trench planting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It consists in making a trench in which you will dump kitchen waste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you cover it with a little bit of soil and plant whatever you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the plant grows, the kitchen waste will be already decomposing and it will provide to the plant the nutrients from that degradation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbwVlBzAGZU">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="starting-disclaimer">Starting disclaimer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No everybody has access to the same resources and the same amount of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, we have different numbers of spaces to make and store the compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this vlog, Huw showcases *his method to become self-sufficient in compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="definition-of-self-sufficiency">Definition of self-sufficiency&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It can be different for all of us. To Huw, the goal is to create all the mulching compost he needs for the garden and for transplanting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, at the time of the shooting, he still purchases seed compost (e.g., potting compost) because he hasn’t perfected his own yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Self-sufficiency is a journey that takes time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="types-of-compost">Types of compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We find the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>standard compost, the one you apply in a layer of 2 to 3 cm each year on your beds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>inoculated compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nutrishous compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and the fourth one can be in &lt;em>The Living Soil Handbook&lt;/em> from Jesse Frost.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It’s available &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3EMDfKB">in France&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3VeWYIq">in the UK&lt;/a> and the&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ENTBmn"> US&lt;/a>. It provides clear and detailed tips to build up life in your soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jesse describes the four types of composts in depth.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-much-compost">How much compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw’s favorite bed size is a 3 m by 1.2 m with a depth of 20 cm (rough estimate from the vlog).&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a mulch layer of 2 cm, it will require 100 liters of compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Count the number of beds you have and time that by 100 liters. It will give the compost amount you need for your garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, take a 20% extra so you’re sure not to run out.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Of course, not everyone can build a garden with the same rectangular frame.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, my garden has a weird shape, so the beds are rarely rectangular.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So make your beds with creativity, using the space efficiently,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, using the material you have available for free can decrease your bill.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="making-compost">Making compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Remember: compost is decomposed material, it means that the original materials have been broken down and you will get about one third in the volume of what you put in on the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, this ratio is dependent on what you put on the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you look at the compost you need to make, you might feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So Huw suggests to spread the load.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="making-compost-in-the-alleys">Making compost in the alleys&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Huw spreads all kinds of material in the alleys between the beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It equals to about 10 cm to 15 cm layer. When it&amp;rsquo;s ready, he sifts it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That way he can get about 200 liters of compost, enough for the two beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="chicken-compost">Chicken compost&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Checkout &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/edibleacres">EdibleAcres&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GeoffLawtonOnline">Geoff Lawton&lt;/a> channels that talk about this topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advantage of chicken compost is that the chicken will eat the seeds they find in the bedding.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="worm-compost">Worm compost&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This compost is usually very nutritious. It’s used more as a supplement rather than a sole use for your garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hot-beds">Hot beds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It’s more a gardening technique than a compost making technique.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, it’s about using the warmth of compost in the making to grow vegetables you wouldn’t grow in certain times of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And at the end, you have harvested the crops that grew in those hot beds and you will find yourself with a huge amount of great quality compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sourcing-materials">Sourcing materials&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="grass-clippings">Grass clippings&lt;/h3>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw thinks it could work well on the previously mentioned deep mulch chicken compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Always be on the lookup" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Always be on the lookup&lt;/p>&lt;p>When you make your compost, you will need to be mindful to the material you can gather to make your compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People throw a lot of things that can go on the compost heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m preparing to look around my area to see who would be giving away their grass clippings, saving them time as they don’t have to go the local public waste factory.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="woodchips">Woodchips&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Woodchips come not only from the freshly cut branches, but also the sawmill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first type, called fragmented rameal wood, comes from the small branches. Their width shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exceed 7 cm in diameter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those branches contain more nutrients than bigger pieces and, with two to three years, you can use it as compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saw-dust">Saw dust&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Saw dust creates a fine texture because of its natural form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So using compost with a good portion of saw dust might just be the good recipe for potting compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And you may wonder if it isn’t too high in carbon and that it might suck the nitrogen out of the ground. Well, it’s always a matter of balance. You won’t apply saw dust as is the beds. You will mix it with some green material and let it degrade.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Having used saw dust the past year to make my compost from grass clipping mixed the saw dust and kitchen waste, I have to say that the result in terms of texture and look seems promising.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will use it next year and I’ll report my findings.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="A word of caution" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">A word of caution&lt;/p>&lt;p>Make sure the wood saw dust you collect is free from preservatives before you plan to put it on a compost heap.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="dead-leaves">Dead leaves&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Same as saw dust, dead leaves are available and cheap, and mixed well with green materials, you can create a great compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I use leaves as my winter duvet for the garden in a 10 cm to 20 cm layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I don’t have the best orientation in the winter with about four and a half hours of sun (weather permitting), I don’t plant anything during the winter months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year was my first year applying this covering and by the end of this year harvest, I can tell you, the leaves have all disappeared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it has helped to create a smoother soil, from which I can more easily pull out the weeds.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;p>It’s high in nitrogen, so you can assimilate it to a green material.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="other-materials">Other materials&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Obviously, your kitchen waste participate to filling the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I put in 5 liters of kitchen waste daily, mainly vegetables waste.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The local highly available weeds can become a great source of material. Huw has a lot of bracken (&lt;em>Pteridium&lt;/em>) around his garden.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cardboard suits a lot of applications in the garden: from covering in the No Dig method to brown material additions to the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Glues on cardboard" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Glues on cardboard&lt;/p>&lt;p>Huw tells glues are almost always strach-based, meaning they come from a plant-based source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, verify your sources.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Huw lives near the coast so he harvests seaweed from the coastline after a storm or a high tide.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="How to remove the salt" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">How to remove the salt&lt;/p>&lt;p>Lay it on the ground a little while then let it dry and it will be ready to use.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Finally, using cover crops produces a lot of materials to bulk up the compost heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out the channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/davidthegood">David the Good&lt;/a> as he explains it in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidthegood/search?query=cover%20crop">these vlogs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="set-goals-that-you-can-attain">Set goals that you can attain&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first challenge is to gather the materials. Finding a place to pile it up won’t be a challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So for your first year, brainstorm:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>where you can get the materials,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>then build your heap using wood pallets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>finally, start filling the first heap&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Within a year, you will have your very own homemade compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>My goal for the 2022–2023 year is:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="fill-the-tray-with-compost">Fill the tray with compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Use a fine compost will make it easier to fit the compost in the small module cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Follow those steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>pour the compost in the cells&lt;/li>
&lt;li>push down with your fingers on the compost into the cells
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it will hold more moisture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the compost will hold together better when you prick out the seedling&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>create little holes where you will drop the seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-deep-should-you-sow">How deep should you sow&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s best not to sow to deep (no more than 2 cm) so the seeds can come out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="peas">Peas&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Put 2 or 3 seeds per cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Push the peas a little bit deeper than the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="radish">Radish&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Put 4 or 5 seeds per cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more you put in each cell, the smaller the radishes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="beetroot">Beetroot&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Put 4 or 5 seeds per cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s hard to sow beetroot direct because the seedlings are prone to pest attack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you have grown them in modules, they tend to resist better.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="onion">Onion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For onions, put about 6 seeds per cell. For spring onions, put 2 more per cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cover with compost the holes and firm it before watering well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This system is applying to more people than Charles’s huge compost heap I have taken not about. See my other notes on the matter using the &lt;a href="../../../tag/compost/">&lt;em>Compost&lt;/em> tag&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-brief-explanation-of-the-system">A brief explanation of the system&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles simply uses wood pallets, from which he knocks off the bottom to make them more lightweight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then he attaches the sides with a wire at each top and bottom corners.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-fill-the-heaps">How long does it take to fill the heaps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For Charles, it takes two months with his large garden (one and a half acres).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might take less for you. Hence, you will need to adjust the size of the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>For example, I don’t produce nor possess enough material to fill a heap made of full-sized pallets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I made one from half of a pallet and I will see if I need bigger or not as I manage to gather more material.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="turning-the-compost">Turning the compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You don’t need to turn it often. Save yourself some energy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles does it once in the lifecycle of compost making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the presented heap system, you only need to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>remove the wires from one side (see &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3gAwfzy0qLw?t=190">at 3:10 in the vlog&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and use a manure fork to turn the compost from one heap to the neighbor (see &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3gAwfzy0qLw?t=200">at 3:20 in the vlog&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The manure fork is easier to use than a digging fork. Buy one! If you can, look at the place where they sell second-hand items. I have found mine for 3 euros that way!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a three-bay structure, you take the content of the side heaps into the middle one.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="timings-when-making-the-compost">Timings when making the compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Turning depends on how long it takes to fill the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m sure how long you have to wait, but let’s take this simple example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Degradation is visible when the content level of the heap decreases. If you fill full your heap, turn it when it’s half full.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you simply follow levels in a given to know when to turn into the middle.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the moisture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the heat&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Why would you want to do that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you put a huge layer of grass clippings, for example, as it degrades, it might rot and air might not be sufficiently present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles provides a concrete example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>set a 7 cm layer of grass clippings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>then set a 2 cm layer of dead leaves or paper or cardboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In terms of volume, you put more green material than brown material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, in terms of dry matter, it represents 50/50 ratio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, even the green vegetable waste like courgette leaves contains:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the leaf itself (green material)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the stem (more brown, even if it looks green ;))&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="about-weeds-and-seeds">About weeds and seeds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can put them on: bindweed, couch grass, flower seeds. Just put them in the middle and cover them well and they won’t reproduce!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heat provides what you need to kill the weeds and the seeds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this temperature range, you retain the fungi activity that is very important too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get a hot compost, you need nitrogen-rich material, aka &lt;em>green material&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fresh leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grass&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kitchen and food waste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fresh manure, either cow or horse&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coffee grounds&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf6CGj7xpFE">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even in winter, you can do it, so let’s look at how and what.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-compost">What can you compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Well, almost anything with no plastic, industrial wax.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost heaps are amazing alchemical processes that degrade pretty much everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Putting citrus on the heap isn’t popular or even it isn&amp;rsquo;t recommended. Yet, Charles composts them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kitchen waste is usually more &lt;em>green&lt;/em> material than &lt;em>brown&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wood ash to the contrary is very much a &lt;em>brown&lt;/em> material.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Charles recommends to put it on the heap rather than directly on the garden beds to use the full potential of the potass as it’s transformed in the heap.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stacks of vegetables (like cabbage) need to be cut into small pieces.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The goal is to maximize the surface area that the bacteria will use to degrade the material.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fresh shredded wood is similar and is a woodier material.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coffee ground isn’t compost until you put it on the heap.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It’s considered a green material.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also, it isn’t acidic, as some say. Yet, the numbers say that the pH is 6.8 on average.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vegetable leaves, especially when they turn yellow.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Leaves turning yellow stop contributing to the plant’s development and, as they fall, the slugs will get involved. You don’t want that to happen.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Weeds are scary, but when you can compost it.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you pull the weeds, you will get the brown from the soil that will come with it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also, popular belief says not to compost perennial weeds. If you continually add material to the heap, the roots of weeds you pulled will die.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The heat will speed the process to kill them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Straw, if you have an organic&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Charles layers the material on the heap and you find air thanks to the brown material to help the green material to degrade.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="heat-in-the-compost-heap">Heat in the compost heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can make cool compost, heat isn’t a requirement but it speeds the transformation of the materials into compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between 55 °C and 70 °C, you have what it needs to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>kill weed seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>create a good environment for bateria and fungi&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-know-the-heap-is-finished">How do you know the heap is finished&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Or in other words, when do you know you need to fill up another heap?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can go on a long time if you don’t add a lot frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s when the sizing of the bay is important: it’s better to have a smaller bay that you fill quickly than a bay too large that never gets filled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles’s three-quarter of an acre garden provides a lot of materials. He fills his six large bays (1.5 m by 1.5 m) easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of his bays can contain one ton of compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He turns the compost once from the filled bay into the neighbor bay.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-options-for-container">What options for container&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you can’t build a structure as big as Charles or if you don’t need so a large structure, use wood pallets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You just need to cover the sides with cardboard to keep the moisture.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-danger" id=" Very important" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title"> Very important&lt;/p>&lt;p>You want your compost to be moist, not wet. If it’s too wet, air is absent and bacteria can’t thrive in an anaerobic environment.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If no more than two drops fall off your hands, the moisture is a good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Don’t just use the look of the compost to judge the moisture levels&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-the-color">What about the color&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A dark brown is better than a jet black concerning compost’s color.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Green waste compost is often very black because it was very hot and it might not be a good news. The level of microbes and micro-organisms is probably low.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well-rotted cow manure can make nice compost and it’s less dark than the green waste compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the homemade compost with a very good balance of green and brown gives a lighter shade of brown compared to the cow manure compost.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="turning-compost">Turning compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Its purpose is to introduce new air in the compost and one doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to perform the task regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, when the heap is full and of a brown color, you can turn it into another heap, like Charles does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turning is also the occasion to break down the lumps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turned compost is left alone for another few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sifting the compost isn’t a must. When you want to use it for your potting, then sifting is necessary for obvious reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="myths-of-compost">Myths of compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following myths are more annoying than anything else:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Separating materials that are said not to go on the heap (ex: root of perennial weeds, citrus)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Instead, cover them well so they can grow in the heap and you will be fine.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diseased vegetable leaves
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The diseases, like blight, can’t survive without a living host&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heat is a must
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No, like I wrote above, it’s a bonus. You can make a great compost with no heat.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFqHe9qqZwU">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In early summer, everything is growing fast. So you need to be present and be on the lookout.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="weeding">Weeding&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even if the No Dig method with cardboard works efficiently, the weeds don’t die out right away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to watch for them to come out here and there for a few months or even a couple of years after applying the cardboard and compost layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sure thing is that you won’t get as much, so it’s reducing the work performed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tidying-up-the-garden">Tidying up the garden&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Interestingly, Charles tells us that the slugs like the old leaves of vegetables the most, kind of like they tidy up the place by eating what we won’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They have a role, they aren’t just there to annoy the gardener.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here, we learn that to keep the slug away, clean the vegetables from old leaves. I’m interested to see how I can put this into action next spring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="succession-cropping">Succession cropping&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In early summer, some vegetables near readiness for harvest, you will be able to replace the old crops with new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sowing in module trays the next crops in advance is key to maximize the growing seasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, you can sow beetroots in modules, 4 weeks before you harvest cabbages, so that they’re ready to plant right after the cabbage harvest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another example is replacing broad beans with cabbage in the beginning of summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-sow-in-the-beginning-of-june-in-the-uk">What can you sow in the beginning of June in the UK&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Boltardy beetroot" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Boltardy beetroot&lt;/p>&lt;p>It’s a fast-growing variety and it can be used for early sowing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beetroots are sown in pockets of about 4 seeds, remembering that some seeds won’t germinate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles thins the seedlings down to 4 beetroots per module.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Spring onions" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Spring onions&lt;/p>&lt;p>They’re sown in pockets of about 8–10 seeds per module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spring onions are very versatile because you can eat them when they’re small, or let them grow into bulbs.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Gowrie swede" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Gowrie swede&lt;/p>&lt;p>They’re sown in pockets of about 2–3 seeds per module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, you will need to thin to one root.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What else? In mid to late spring, Charles sowed the following, which are ready to be planted in the beginning of June:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Red cabbage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kale&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leak&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brussels sprouts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Runner beans&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cucumber&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="growing-seedlings">Growing seedlings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>They will need warmth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In early summer, it’s easy to have warmth, but for Charles in the UK, he puts his seedling in the greenhouse, watering them every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="more-about-spring-onions-that-grew-during-the-winter">More about spring onions that grew during the winter&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles planted the spring onions below last August.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to eat them, you need to watch out the seed head, unless you want to harvest seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A spring onion will turn a bit woody if left too long in the ground with the seed head growing.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="planting-leaks-while-clearing-space">Planting leaks while clearing space&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles clears out some kohlrabi sown in February, planted early April with a net on to prevent cabbage root flies to attack them.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="About cabbage root flies" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">About cabbage root flies&lt;/p>&lt;p>Charles doesn’t have a solution against the cabbage root flies except for the net over it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He talked about another technique, but people have reported it doesn’t work.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Then, you will need to remove any weed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also walk on the bed, especially after harvesting kohlrabi or anything with big roots to firm the compost again.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Remember" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Remember&lt;/p>&lt;p>Walking on your bed covered with compost, you can’t compact it. You’ll firm it.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="Why not make your bed too mounded" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Why not make your bed too mounded&lt;/p>&lt;p>When you pour water on it, even with a soil covered with compost, the water will run off to the sides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you want the bed to be leveled. It’s easier to water and keep the moisture on the bed.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>After you watered maybe a second time, you’re ready to plan the leaks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want a longer white stem, you need to plan them deep.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="intersow-a-new-crop-with-another-growing">Intersow a new crop with another growing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Why would you do that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Often, you will run out of space to sow the next crop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it’s possible if you intersow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, Charles is sowing carrots between lettuce.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You will need to water well on the inside of the trench only so it’s efficient in water usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Tip" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Tip&lt;/p>&lt;p>Wait a little bit before sowing the seeds, just like for the leeks earlier.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Sowing carrots requires precision. You don’t want too many sown in the same space. It’s always possible to thin them. But you could also save seeds by sowing just what you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles advices to sow one or two seeds every centimeter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, after putting back the compost over the seeds, walk on the compost to firm it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don’t need to water more if you followed the watering of the trench at the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="timing-of-planting">Timing of planting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can easily plant too early. So learn about your climate and when it’s best to plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Curry squash and climbing bean need warmth so planting in late may to early June for zone 8 in the UK&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In contrast, broad beans (&lt;em>fève&lt;/em> in French) are planted in November to December.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You have probably seen the structure of growing beans on a wall-like structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It tends to weaken against the wind, while tippees show more sturdiness, as they diffuse the wind coming onto them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about-watering">About watering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Watering well when planting is key. Use a good amount to make the soil really moist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, don’t water them for a while, the plants will then need to make their roots down, looking for water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it isn’t the case for lettuce. The vegetables you harvest regularly need watering the most.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coriander, spinach, peas fall in that category as well. Always depending on your weather, watering once every 2–3 days is enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With compost, it slowly releases the water to the plants, as it acts as a sponge&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Where I live in Ardèche, I do also water every other day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most difficult time is when the sun literally burns everything like this past summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So think about shading. It doesn’t have to block all the sun, but it will help tremendously to keep your crops alive.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="reminders-about-compost">Reminders about compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You need to give air to the compost, using a &lt;em>compost mixer&lt;/em> tool, like &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3WZKFRS">this one&lt;/a> that I use for two years now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I sue the technique of filling out my heaps in layers with green and brown. The green comes from the kitchen waste I throw away (5 liters per day) and the brown comes from dead leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can put weeds in the compost, but you will need heat. A big heap allows you to build up sufficient heat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep your compost covered, the worms will thank you for that as they like dark and moist.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i7yAYenaQk">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article provides you a summary of the trial Charles conducted to compare two composts to grow the same vegetables.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-trial-setup">The trial setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles compares two composts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mushroom compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Composted cow manure&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Mushroom compost contains more nutrients than regular green waste compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Animal manure compost depends on the type of bedding that they were on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-results">The results&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On the strip with mushroom compost, the yields over 3 years were the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Composted cow manure&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Mushroom compost&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>229.26 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;td>251.94 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>You would have thought that cow manure would have produced more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="in-detail">In detail&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No carrots grew up in the bed covered with cow manure compost. See &lt;a href="#why-those-results">below why&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Potatoes, lettuce and chicory yielded a similar amount.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leeks and cabbages looked better in the cow manure compost. However, in that same compost, Charles feels like the broad beans note yielding as much as the other compost (mushroom compost), in the same area, may have left more nutrients for the next vegetables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chinese cabbages aren’t doing well in the cow manure, for the same reason as the carrots.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Squashes yielded more crops in the mushroom compost.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="why-those-results">Why those results&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Simply put: the little bit of straw brings snails and slugs eating crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="personal-comments-on-straw">Personal comments on straw&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have found that straw helps to retain moisture. But autumn leaves provided me with a better result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also leaves keep the badgers away, or at least they don’t attract them as the straw does. Two years ago, I had replanted peas three times because the badgers came to plow the garden!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year, with leaves, they still came, but a lot fewer times.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Discover the problems when you plant in fresh manure rather than compost, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/discover-the-problems-manure-vs-compost-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/discover-the-problems-manure-vs-compost-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-10-discover-the-problems-when-you-plant-in-fresh-manure-rather-than-compost-charles-dowding.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Discover the problems when you plant in fresh manure rather than compost, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>The best way to discover something is to try them out! Charles shares an example in this vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veHKCN73tUc">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A guy contacted him about using fresh manure as a great way to grow potatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So Charles decided to try also.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-take-out-of-using-fresh-horse-manure">The take out of using fresh horse manure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>He sees a lot of weeds growing, in addition to the nice vegetables. I had the same experience where common purslane grew a lot after applying fresh manure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the great news, it’s easy to remove those weeds from the hay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tells us how efficient a proper composting process, e.g., getting the temperatures up, is to kill weed seeds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You need to add regularly material onto the heap and in the proper proportion of green and brown, e.g., in a 50/50 ratio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in fresh manure, vegetables can grow. But so the weeds in the hay ;)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pyralid weedkillers in compost, explained by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/pyralid-weedkillers-in-compost-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/pyralid-weedkillers-in-compost-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-09-pyralid-weedkillers-in-compost-amino-and-clopyralid-effects-and-healing-charles-dowding.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Pyralid weedkillers in compost, explained by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Charles talks about aminopyralid weedkiller in his compost because residues were present in the hay and horse manure used to make the compost.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-doesnt-aminopyralid-weedkiller-affect">What doesn’t aminopyralid weedkiller affect&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It doesn’t affect the grass family, which I find amazing when we’re talking about a &lt;strong>weed&lt;/strong>killer…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It doesn’t affect the Brassicaceae family (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbages…)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the peas and broad beans are really diseased. But also, tomatoes, strawberries and lettuces will go yellow…&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s generally accepted that the trial to understand the effects of weedkillers on plants isn’t conducted well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bioassay reveals the effects for the plant to assimilate the nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A bioassay is a measurement of the concentration or potency of a substance by its effect on living cells or tissues.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This technique will tell you if the poison is present in the plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the image above, Charles thinks the concentration isn’t very high in his trial but it’s definitely present…&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-is-present">Where is present&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Often, it’s present in horse manure, but also you can find it in cow manure or hay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even a 10-year-old manure will contain it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-heal-the-contaminated-soil">How to heal the contaminated soil&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will need about 10 days of warm days and enough watering to break down the compounds in aminopyralid weedkiller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s the soil life that will break down the poisons.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>How does Charles know that? A consultant of the company came down to explain it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He told him he thought it was manganese deficiency and that the company didn’t get a lot of notifications about issues with their poison… I’m sure that has changed with Charles’s warnings in this vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles thinks and hopes that growth will improve, but he suggests to wait another year to grow plants in the same area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, for UK citizens, you can report the problems in manure to &lt;a href="https://www.corteva.co.uk/manure-matters.html">this website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As Charles tells us often, you don’t need to wait much before planting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="no-dig-loosens-the-soil">No Dig loosens the soil&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With the No Dig method and using compost, the soil is already loose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How? With all the dead weed roots left in the soil, you find out that air is present and the compost in coming feed the life thriving. Your vegetables therefore benefit from all that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the scenario that Charles showcased in the vlog, I’d say he uses about 2 to 3 cm of compost on top of the usual cardboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When it comes to grow a lot more vegetables, you will need more compost indeed. However, because you need less ground to grow your vegetables, you will need less compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-plan">My plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’m planning to purchase about a ton of &lt;em>green compost&lt;/em> to go further into the No Dig method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I’ll need to pay 26 euros per ton, but transportation and accessibility to my property require that I rent a truck for 75 euros for half a day…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One ton of that compost will equal to 2000 liters. The equivalent surface area represents 20 m² with a 10 cm layer of compost. It feels like nothing, but a bed of 2 meters by 10 meters provides a lot of places to grow vegetables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then remember that the vegetables you grow will produce waste that you can compost to make your own compost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Start Out No Dig, a method with cardboard and compost, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/starting-no-dig-with-cardboard-and-compost-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/starting-no-dig-with-cardboard-and-compost-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-07-a-basket-of-vegetables.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Start Out No Dig, a method with cardboard and compost, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>In this vlog, Charles explains how to start No Dig.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LH6-w57Slw">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="definition-of-mulch">Definition of mulch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mulch can be anything that covers the surface you apply it to keep the light out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-to-start-the-no-dig-bed">Where to start the No Dig bed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A very weedy area, a lawn are good candidates for a no dig bed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-do-you-need">What do you need&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will need:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cardboard, because it’s the cheapest covering material&lt;/li>
&lt;li>wool&lt;/li>
&lt;li>compost&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you don’t have any weed, you’re rare lucky person. Most of us will start from a weedy patch of land.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the following notes, we will see how Charles will free us so much time in our gardening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weeding bores and tires you and all the time used to weed isn’t the time to grow strong and healthy vegetables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Charles’s method leaves the soil undisturbed, which is essential for a life-rich soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weeds aren’t pulled, they stay there and eventually, they give up growing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles put it nicely: if you try to dig out the weed, they will be hurt but they will have &lt;em>the will to grow more&lt;/em> and you will harm your soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="about-the-cardboard">About the cardboard&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can find it easily for free. But:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>use a brown cardboard, not the shiny ones that contain plastic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>remove the tape and staples, if any&lt;/li>
&lt;li>avoid cardboard with ink, unless you’re sure it’s vegetable-based ink.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-first-application">The first application&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You will need to delimit your bed area and the pathways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then apply a layer of cardboard over it, making sure no gap exists that will let the weeds through. Indeed, the weeds will find their way if you’re wary about the cardboard position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s important to make sure the cardboard overlap generously to prevent light to reach the craving weeds underneath.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-compost-to-use">What compost to use&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Fresh manure isn’t recommended. Even well-rotted cow manure doesn’t perform as well as his homemade compost, Charles finds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember the goal is to be able to sow in straight away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Green waste compost: it comes from general garden waste, debris, prunings, etc.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This compost usually has a darker color and its performance isn’t quite as good as homemade compost&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Homemade compost: it comes from general garden waste, fibers, prunings, wood, etc.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It doesn’t look as fine as the green waste compost. Also, you don’t need to sift it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mushroom compost: it needs to be well decomposed. Charles didn’t say much about how it’s made, so I ask in the vlog’s comments section.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Spread a 10 cm layer of compost on top of the cardboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don’t hesitate to firm the compost with your feet. It does need firmness, not loose nor compact. But the great thing about compost is that it’s never compact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To contain the compost in the bedding area, you can use wood framing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue that can arise is getting hold of a lot of compost. It’s difficult, but read in my other notes I took from Charles’s videos on the topic of compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to hunt for the materials in your neighborhood. It will surprise you how much waste people will be delighted to give away for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pathways-around-the-beds">Pathways around the beds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The easiest and cheapest way to do it’s to use woodchips, decomposed or not, it will feed the soil life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They will dig for you but in a much more gentle manner, keeping the carbon dioxide in the ground, whereas when you dig, you release carbon dioxide…&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="maintain-an-edge">Maintain an edge&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>An edge is anything that covers about 20 cm extra more space than your bed is taking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will help to keep the grass to jump the rich soil of your bed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use small wood beams and cardboard as shown below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="you-need-up-to-three-or-four-cardboard-applications">You need up to three or four cardboard applications&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When the weeds start to grow through the first layer of cardboard on the pathways, it’s time to pull the weeds, if it’s easy, and apply another layer of cardboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Always make sure to overlap the piece of cardboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to apply each layer about every six weeks unless the weeds have died.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tire-the-weeds-by-removing-the-small-shoots">Tire the weeds by removing the small shoots&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It’s possible to remove all weeds with time and patience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patrol around the garden where you put the cardboard, pull out the young shoots of weeds and the parent root will die at one point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can take a few years, however, to tire some of the strongest weeds like the bindweeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s achievable and you need to be patient.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="using-soil-on-a-new-bed">Using soil on a new bed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles doesn’t use soil when he builds a new bed because vegetables grow much better in compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use-propagation-to-give-the-best-start-to-seedlings">Use propagation to give the best start to seedlings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles recommends not to sow directly in the ground because it’s vulnerable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Propagation means sowing the seed or multi-sown seeds in a module until the seedling is big enough to be transplanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles has severable vlogs on the topics, check out the &lt;em>propagation&lt;/em> tag. &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/comparing-different-composts-for-propagation-charles-dowding/">These notes are a good starting point&lt;/a> from a more recent vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="planting-in-a-no-dig-bed">Planting in a No Dig bed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Planting is simple since the compost is easy to dig into using two fingers.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The demonstration (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0LH6-w57Slw?t=1250">available at minute 20:50 in the vlog&lt;/a>) above showcases how simple it is, requiring no tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About spacing, Charles suggests 30 cm between each plant for beetroots. I’ve come across many vlogs so far on spacing. But I will certainly do, check out the tags when you read this, I may have a tag &lt;em>Spacing seedlings&lt;/em> or something similar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, remember that you will be able to do succession planting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>planting lettuce after the peas,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>planting beetroots after the spring onions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="a-comment-about-a-few-vegetables">A comment about a few vegetables&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Root vegetables transplant well, unlike you may have heard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, where does this belief come from? Is it because of the dig method not working well showing? Isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem in the action of transplanting but rather because of the method used to grow the vegetables?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, birds tend to eat broccoli, so you’ll need to protect them with nets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kale is a great vegetable, to be sown in May and transplanted in June. It will give you food in the winter months and even early spring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Keep thinking ahead, have seedlings ready for the months to come, even if it’s winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You want to keep eating from your garden all year long ultimately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to start small, though. I took notes on the topic in a vlog by Huw Richards. He explains &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/the-simple-way-to-food-self-sufficiency-huw-richards/">the simple way to becoming self-sufficient in food&lt;/a>. Have a read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about the storage of your vegetables. Garlic and onions harvested in the summer will stay indoors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, eating home-grown produce is also great for you because it contains a lot of microbes very beneficial to your digestive track.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding&amp;rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeBUX9iEFwg">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth spending time making some decent compost because it has a multiplier effect all the way along down the line.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="heap-location">Heap location&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s very convenient when you&amp;rsquo;ve got your heat reasonably central, because then it&amp;rsquo;s less time needed for bringing stuff to the beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In No Dig gardening, it is the main input of time: applying the compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-makes-great-compost">What makes great compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed some heat in your compost: it is the batteria at work, especially when you have got a lot of green in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, the fungis are important as well. They don&amp;rsquo;t like it too hot, hence, not going above 70 °C is important to them alive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, a good balance of green materials and brown materials added in the heap in layers to help the decomposition to happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on your location and weather, you will want to avoid the heap to be under the rain, if you receive as much rain as Charles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Covering the heap will be necessary then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, putting in fibery materials like stems, paper or cardboard will help to bring some air after mixing it in the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-is-it-ready">When is it ready&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Well, that depends on your condition and the following checklist:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>is it still warm?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>has it been turned?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>has it been decomposing for 6 months at least?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>is there any worm?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Then you can go ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, it will depend on how much heat you were able to have. The more you heat the compost (staying under 70 °C for the fungal activity), the fastest the compost will be ready to use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Compost is balancing green &amp; brown, with Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/compost-making-balancing-nitrogen-and-carbon-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/compost-making-balancing-nitrogen-and-carbon-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-04-aerial-view-of-charles-garden-as-he-walks-to-the-compost-heap.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Compost is balancing green &amp; brown, with Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Successful compost can be summarized by a good a good balance of green or brown. Let&amp;rsquo;s review the must-know with Charles.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtMsEylZvqw">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>It’s difficult to look at it too scientifically about it and the quantity of the materials one is adding vary all the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No two gardens are the same. So the materials you will have won’t be the same as Charles or I add.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’ll be perhaps broadly similar but you will always find subtle differences. So don’t worry too much about being precise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ratio-of-green-and-brown">Ratio of green and brown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The mix of green and brown should be at least half green and half brown. But what is green and what is brown?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="comment-about-carbon-to-nitrogen-balance">Comment about carbon to nitrogen balance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s often talked about in books. And it confuses things because the proportion given is two parts of carbon to one part of nitrogen. So it’s more a ratio of 33% green to 66% of brown. Very few things are pure green and similarly to brown material.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="definition-of-green">Definition of green&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What is &lt;em>mostly&lt;/em> green? Here is a sample list:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All fresh leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vegetable peels&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kitchen waste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Weed leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Young tree leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fresh manure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coffee grounds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Urine&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="definition-of-brown">Definition of brown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What is &lt;em>mostly&lt;/em> brown? Here is a sample list:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Woody materials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Old stems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prunings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dry tree leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Soil (in small quantity)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wood ash&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Paper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cardboard&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-ok-to-put-diseases-material-on-the-compost-heap">What is OK to put diseases material on the compost heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s OK to put on vegetable leaves with mildew, for example. For Charles, it doesn’t cause a problem to the finished product. He has used blighted potatoes leaves, rust of garlic or leeks and all went in the heap. For the case of blight, the disease needs living tissues and when the waste green of the plant goes on the heap, the disease will no longer persist.&lt;/p>

You can put seed on the heap, but put it in the middle where you get the most heat, warranting to kill the seeds. You can put on thistle in as well. A lot of myths, generally accepted, exist about what can&amp;rsquo;t and what can be put in the heap.&lt;/p>

We don’t see very clearly the brown layers, but it’s there in the ratio stated above. We can see a lot of vegetable stems that contain more &lt;em>brown&lt;/em> than green leaves. Also depending on seasons, you will have available a various amounts of green and brown. Spring is the height of the green season. Summer is a bit more balanced green and brown And then autumn is more brown material and finally winter is very brown.

So you’ve got different seasons, you have different materials.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-build-a-heap-at-all">Why build a heap at all&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A heap will hold the materials, it will hold the heat and it will make it tidier. Also, Charles has a lot of solids and it’s often said that a compost heat should have slated sides to allow some passenger in (insects, small animals, etc.). Air is a vital ingredient in compost making because that is what bacteria breathe on to live and multiply. And they do a lot of the breakdown: they’re what brings the heat in the heap. The brown material, especially larger pieces, will allow to have more air in the heap, helping the battery to do their job.

You would ask: why use solid sides to build a heap? Charles explains that it helps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>retain the heat and moisture better&lt;/li>
&lt;li>slatted sides don’t allow a worthwhile amount of air in. They are lined inside with cardboard, so no air enters, moisture and warmth are retained as explained &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3gAwfzy0qLw">in this vlog&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="store-brown">Store brown&lt;/h2>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> Expand Down
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>During spring and summer, you have less brown available. So store away leaves, for example. I’m currently _harvest&lt;em>ing dead leaves, literally all I can get in my neighborhood. I will probably build some kind of heap just for the leaves so I can _sprinkle&lt;/em> them into my compost in the making.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="point-about-weed-roots">Point about weed roots&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Bindweeds are big trouble for the gardeners. I know I have got a lot. Charles isn’t afraid to say that putting in even the roots in the heap is OK. And these roots aren’t indestructible. We give them too much credit. They seem invincible, but they’re not A weed root has only so much energy, so if you can keep it away from the light while it’ll try to grow, it’ll do so or it gets too hot and die from that. And as it tries to grow, it’s using up its energy and it withers at the end. Of course, don’t just put a lot on the heap and leave them to grow. So:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cover them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>put them in the middle of the heap and heat will take care of them It’s the same for couch grass, perennial thistles.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="sizing-your-heap">Sizing your heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you’re like Charles, you could replicate on 1.5 m by 1.5 m heap structure, but you will need 3000 m² of land with a sizable vegetable garden and the lawn and edges. Otherwise, you need to find out your size by starting small. I don’t have a large garden nor access to lots of material. I would suggest to start with Charles’s pallets heap structure that are cheaper to make and smaller. And even if it’s still too big, cut pallets in half. That’s what I’m doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finding-material-if-you-cant-produce-enough">Finding material if you can’t produce enough&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Like I said above, I personally harvest dead leaves. This year, I will try to harvest all I can. Use your vegetable waste, which supposes that you eat fresh food, not prepared meals… My family throws away 5 liters each day! And actually, it’s really difficult to get material sometimes unless you get very good at scrounging. So ask your neighbors. Put the words out around you! You might be surprised.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about-temperature">About temperature&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Buy one of these thermometers &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3Up27gt">in France&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3UaOqlx">in the UK&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3DyAWZP">in the US&lt;/a> to measure the heat. You can make compost without heat, like leaf mold. Heat is just speeding up the process of decomposition. You should also watch the heat so it doesn’t go too much over 70 °C. Over that, you will use fungal activities. If you get over 70 °C, it usually happens as a &lt;em>flash&lt;/em> of heat after adding new green material.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-watering">What about watering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It doesn’t apply to what Charles has put on the heap in this vlog, which was mostly green. Also, too much moisture removes air from the materials and bacteria can’t live in it. You need water if it’s quite dry or if you have got a lot of brown. But in Charles’s case, where he lives, it’s quite wet all year long, so the quality of his compost has increased from the roof over his heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="maintaining-your-heap">Maintaining your heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, write when you start it. Also, when is it good to stop filling it? Well, as long as the levels keep lowering fast, you can keep filling it. You will notice very easily when it’s slowing. Next, you don’t need to turn often your compost, despite what you have heard. You always can, but it takes time to do so and isn’t it better to use this time to gather materials instead? Charles performs only one turning. &lt;strong>Go for it now!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0V-5qXQz9U">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They shot the vlog on the 8th of September 2019. So this is the 6th year of doing this comparison.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles says it’s a trial, but you could call it an experiment, but it’s not a scientific experiment as such.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>It’s comparing things&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-strip-one-and-two-setup">The strip One and Two setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="strip-one">Strip One&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Charles puts a fork in the ground and levers it to loosen the soil, e.g., broad forking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the idea being to just see what difference that it makes to growth compared to no dig.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="striptwo">Strip Two&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It’s a No Dig strip with the same compost as strip One.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="strip-three">Strip Three&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It’s a No Dig strip with the well-rotted cow manure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="soil-and-amendment-composition">Soil and amendment composition&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first two strips have the same amount of compost put on at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles uses mushroom compost and green waste compost on strips One and Two.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-charles-cultivated">What Charles cultivated&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The same plants are planted at the same time in each of the strips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the winter and spring months, the strips have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Spinach&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lettuce&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Potatoes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Broad beans&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Winter squash&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In Winter salad&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the summer and autumn months, the strips have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Kale&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chicory&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cabbage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spinach&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Climbing beans&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>They observed a 5% production different consistently over the five years, especially in the summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="observations-after-five-years-between-strip-two-and-strip-three">Observations after five years between strip Two and strip Three&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The crops look bigger on strip Three, but pest damage offset the harvest yields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, slugs attack the plants, but not always.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, Charles weights the harvest but discarding the outer leaves and anything that you wouldn’t eat or sell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And he observed that strip Three produced more waste over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the end, the strip Two is the best strip.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wini Walbaum &amp; Charles Dowding no dig, straw-hay for dry climate, compost for damp one, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/wini-walbaum-and-charles-dowding-share-no-dig-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/wini-walbaum-and-charles-dowding-share-no-dig-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-01-wini-walbaum-charles-dowding--no-dig--straw-hay-for-dry-climate--compost.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Wini Walbaum &amp; Charles Dowding no dig, straw-hay for dry climate, compost for damp one, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Charles was contacted by some Chilean gardeners practicing no dig gardening.

&lt;h2 id="climates">Climates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Homeacres is wet while Wini leaves in a region that is a Mediterranean climate (very dry).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, No Dig provides them both what they need.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="winis-climate">Wini’s climate&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Chile, it’s essential to keep the water in the ground, to retain moisture and spend less water. Wini has found out that no dig really helps to achieve that.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On the contrary, Charles is trying to make sure the rain is draining. He receives 90 mm of rain every month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, because of No Dig, he needs not to worry about muddy bouts. The compost (for the garden) and woodchips (for the alleys) allow to have a clean soil.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s saying that No Dig is keeping some warmth in the soil.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="who-inspired-charles">Who inspired Charles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before Homeacres, Charles started with a 6000 m² garden that he worked a tractor and rotavotor to chop weeds and the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Manually, he would then make beds for 3 months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But he told himself:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wait a minute, I don’t want to keep doing that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So he started researching and someone told him about a book from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Stout">Ruth Stout&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She taught about mulching with hay and Charles tried that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, slugs ate all the lettuces then… Why? Because in Charles’s climate, the hay hides the slugs that then eat the vegetables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles realized that he needed to modify her approach and he started using compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Very interestingly, Wini found her inspiration through Charles and in her research, she came back to Ruth Stout!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lessons-from-ruth-stout">Lessons from Ruth Stout&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>She rejected the conventional wisdom in regard to gardening and taught to try, see how it works and adjust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1948, on her first no dig bed, she was waiting for the plow to come. But it never came.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So she mulches with hay and it worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tree-and-garden">Tree and garden&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With their roots, trees are draining the water because the root breaks down the soil so it’s then less moist.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>As they said and I agree, it would depend on your situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My garden contains a lot of clay, so having small oaks, an almond tree and plants like comfrey or borage will loosen the soil, which is good for the vegetable I grow.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="visit-of-winis-garden">Visit of Wini’s garden&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What the garden produces is eaten and stored if it can’t be eaten right away. Wini does very little resale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She grows the usual vegetables, but also she tries out other things because of her curiosity and to help her children like what they eat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="original-garden-area-became-wild">Original garden area became wild&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>It will be a lot about teaching and learning, more than producing crops to resale on the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first year is the hardest year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digging this new area would require a lot of energy because of the abundance of clay.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Be happy with clay" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Be happy with clay&lt;/p>&lt;p>No Dig works &lt;strong>really&lt;/strong> well with clay.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>it retains moisture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it provides fertility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it doesn’t stick to boots anymore&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it builds a soil that has a good balance of drainage and moisture.&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="weeding-efficiently">Weeding efficiently&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You will need patience. But eventually, with No Dig, you can vanquish the toughest weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? In facts, covering the ground with cardboard and compost is already keeping the weeds at bay. But also, apply a plastic sheet on top for a month or two will deplete the weed roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, you might need to perform some follow-up work to root out the remaining weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="advantages-of-no-dig">Advantages of No Dig&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First, and let’s repeat it, compost doesn’t burn the roots. Hot compost is what burns the roots. It’s more about waiting for the&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, with a starting bed, you have 10 cm of compost, in which the plants will grow until they reach the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the soil has a lot of growing space, free from weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, while covered with the plastic sheet and waiting for the weeds to die, the soil life processed the compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s very quick to prepare.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="structure-of-the-soil">Structure of the soil&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It doesn’t need to be loose and fluffy. That’s what the rotavotor sellers want us to believe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soil needs to be firm but loose enough to help the roots of vegetables to go down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Firm is better than compact&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Identify problems, with Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/identify-problems-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/identify-problems-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-31-a-garden-bed-with-mostly-squashes.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Identify problems, with Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Gardening is full of conflicting advice.

&lt;p>Charles shares that in his experience, it isn’t the end of the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s more a sequence of events where the plants are losing their older leaves.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Leaves can turn yellow all summer and it’s possible it isn’t a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the uchiki kuri squash won’t do well in a soil with a little bit of gravel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plants-know-how-much-they-produce">Plants know how much they produce&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It will happen, and I have indeed experienced this in the past, that you will see many fruits on a squash plant appearing, and some will grow to maturation and some will root in the early stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s fine and you shouldn’t worry much about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-squash-on-a-compost-heap-doesnt-deplete-the-nutrients">Growing squash on a compost heap doesn’t deplete the nutrients&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="compost-doesnt-burn-the-roots">Compost doesn’t burn the roots&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It isn’t true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s true when the compost heap itself is still very hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hot compost means the early decomposition process is still going on and the plant won’t find enough goodness to grow well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It has been said so often that big root vegetables go woody.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s absolutely not true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe, if it tastes woody, it’s more to do with a poor soil?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sowing Swiss chard shouldn’t happen too early to avoid bolting. Charles suggests for his location to sow charts in April.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cause of charts bolting is the cold exposure if sown too early.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Growing vegetables can be all about compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how to make it and use it?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="it-doesnt-need-to-be-super-thin-and-perfect">It doesn’t need to be super thin and perfect&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Compost can contain pieces, even some wood, as long as it isn’t too big.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will provide the nourishment for fungal life.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You will see tiger or red worms, which are present in the final decomposition phase of the compost. It’s a good indicator that your compost nears readiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You never see them before the temperature in low enough for them to settle in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="do-you-need-solid-sides-on-your-heap">Do you need solid sides on your heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Solid seem to work best, according to Charles’s experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-wood">What wood&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles uses Douglas wood planks, thick enough to hold the pretty big heaps.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="do-the-heaps-need-to-be-in-the-sun-or-shade">Do the heaps need to be in the sun or shade&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It doesn’t matter at all, as the heat comes from the breaking down of the material in the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn’t the sun that will make your compost hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The roof on Charles’s large heaps is to keep the rain off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? To make compost, you need air. If the compost is too soggy, no or little air is present in the heap and that will prevent the battery and the life in the compost to do their work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-often-should-i-turn-my-compost-heap">How often should I turn my compost heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Turning isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily done often. It will help giving the heap some air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles turns it once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His heaps make it easy to transfer the content of a first heap into its neighbor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles has a mobile divider between the heap so he can transfer the content easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="do-you-need-to-layer-the-content-of-the-heap">Do you need to layer the content of the heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Layering helps to make it easier to have a good balance of green and brown material (the 1/3 brown to 2/3 green ratio).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They will like the warmth of the heap, and Charles isn’t overrun by rats so he can’t give much advice about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe it’s because cats or wildlife like weasel eat the rats (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BIV4lljN6Aw?t=503">see a filmed attack at Homeacres at 8:23&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Remember: you can put a lot of things in a heap, even some things that most people wouldn’t put in, like bindweed. I have been watching Charles’s vlogs for a while and tested myself the ideas he shares and I can tell you it is true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles explains that the bindweed loses the contact with the parent root in the heap. Within a month or two, the pulled-out roots loose the resources to develop and they die, even a cool heap.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="About weed seeds" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">About weed seeds&lt;/p>&lt;p>You must have heat to kill seeds, between 60 °C to 70 °C. Otherwise, they grow once you spread the compost in the beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But because they are on the top, it is easy to root them out again. But do it early!&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;li>Attach the sides together with a wire on top and bottom (and even in the middle if necessary)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put cardboard around the inside edges to keep the light out and the moisture as you will fill in the heap.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>You can put:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>blighted tomato and potatoes leaves, stems and fruits (because blight can’t survive in the compost heap)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>green vegetable waste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>weeds without the soil (because it will help the weed develop…)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Charles suggests to do the following to hold the structure in the heap:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>5 cm of green&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a thin layer of brown (autumn leaves, for example)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Within &lt;em>about 6 to 10 months&lt;/em>, the compost will be ready. You decide by the look of your compost. You need to try and experience and in the end, you will find the good fit.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Start a No Dig Bed and Compost Differences, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/how-to-start-a-no-dig-bed-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/how-to-start-a-no-dig-bed-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-26-a-man-cleaning-a-lettuce.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to Start a No Dig Bed and Compost Differences, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>The steps are simple and I have validated the process and the efficacy of the technique to creating a living soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laBXwOdbOlw">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will look in this article how Charles suggests how to start no dig in your garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="starting-from-weeds">Starting from weeds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can use cardboard, then you apply a layer of compost, and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have no weeds, it will not be necessary to use cardboard. But who doesn’t have weeds? ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, you can plant straight away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, it is OK to plan in compost&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-big-should-your-new-no-dig-beds-be">How big should your new no dig bed(s) be&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No matter the size, it will be the same area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But maybe start a smaller area.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparing-the-area">Preparing the area&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before you start with the bed, it is a good idea to cover the chosen area with black polythene cover (that you can reuse multiple times).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will serve to weaken the weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do it a month before the actual bed making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key is to keep the light away from the weeds. It will kill the plant’s roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, it is a method that doesn’t disturb the soil. The structure of the soil is important to keep, because we don&amp;rsquo;t see all that is going on in it. It is a very complex system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the life will thrive in such a soil!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="notes-about-light-and-shade">Notes about light and shade&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Shade is OK, and leafy crops will do OK compared to crops really needing the sun light (tomatoes for example).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have leaf-dense trees, maybe pruning them to produce less shade is better than cutting the tree down.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>With a tree, you will have roots and depending on the crops, it can affect the growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But most importantly, the fungal activity that a tree brings is positive for the soil quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So think well before cutting a tree down&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="soil-on-uneven-ground">Soil on uneven ground&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before applying the compost, you can cover the portions of the select area that are uneven with soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why soil rather than compost? It is because of the density of soil which will hold better on the long run. Meanwhile, the compost will shrink and the uneven ground will appear again.&lt;/p>

You can find weed roots like, bindweeds, dandelions, buttercup and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bindweeds might not die in the soil, dandelions and creeping buttercup will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So fish out the bindweed roots!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, it is a fantastic mulch for pathways. Just put cardboard first. It will feed the soil and that is beneficial.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>use brown cardboard&lt;/li>

&lt;p>If cardboard has printing on, it is usually fine if it is vegetable-based inks. It depends on the shop. The rule is: the less ink, the better.&lt;/p>

Charles explains to us in this article the options available and the simplest solution is free!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhHshAf2lpM">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="size-the-heap">Size the heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You need to size your heap according to your garden area and how much waste you will generate from the garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Charles’s case, it is big because he has a big area and in May, time of the vlog shooting, he has a lot of waste, whether it is from the garden or the mowing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Credits: image taken from Charles Dowding’s vlog&lt;/em> Like I wrote in other vlogs, the temperature you want is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>above 50 °C&lt;/li>
&lt;li>around 60 °C to 70 °C to kill weed seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Also, a high temperature will also help producing compost quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get the heat, you will need green materials, like grass, but not only.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fresh manure and coffee-grind work as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="turning-compost-heap">Turning compost heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is mandatory to turn compost from a heap to another.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the above picture, the worms you see were not there before. They are &lt;em>tiger worms&lt;/em> which eggs are the materials put in to make the compost and they are helping the composting process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Charles starts using compost after 7 months as the decomposition will continue on the soil.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For more woody or harder material, like the cauliflower stem below, you should cut it in smaller pieces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles shows below how to cut the stem in the length, which is much easier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wildlife, like mice, toads, frogs, will be found in the heaps.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt4azBLuJrc">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;p>First, the pots are relatively small for the plants growing; therefore, the nutrients might run low at some stage. It will be interesting to see how the plants will handle it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The spring onion is looking better in the pot 13 compared to the pot 12, even though the latter has 25% worm compost… Still, the spinach has a darker color in the pot 12.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pots4-to-6-woodchip-compost-and-co">Pots 4 to 6: woodchip compost and co&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Surprisingly, pot 4 (100% woodchip compost) is doing well, even if, historically, the wood usually takes out more out of the plant. It even has the best-looking onions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pots 5 and 6 show a difference in the size of the spinach (larger in pot 6 and the largest so far).&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apparently, the mushroom compost isn’t very successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? When the mushroom compost was very young, still hot and dry. Also, the compost is holding water much more than the rest, and the roots are probably being asphyxiated…&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pots1-to-3-homemade-compost-and-co">Pots 1 to 3: homemade compost and co&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Again, the homemade compost, pure or with a mix of worm compost, the results are not as Charles expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pots7-to-9-moorland-gold-compost">Pots 7 to 9: Moorland Gold compost&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is doing pretty well, and actually it does better with less worm compost, probably because the Moorland Gold compost is already pretty rich.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The spinach is the darkest one in pots 7 and 9.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="day30-updates">Day 30 updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The progress is producing very interesting results:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In pot 7 (100% Moorland Gold compost), the spinach is getting yellow, which mean the nutrients are running low.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In pot 9 (25% of worm compost and 75% Moorland Gold compost), the onions are much bigger&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pot 12 (soil with worm compost) outperformed pot 13 (pure soil)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Comparing pot 4 (100% woodchip compost) to pot 6 (50% of worm compost and 50% woodchip compost), the former isn’t looking as brilliant as on day 16, with a spinach looking yellow while the onion is OK. However, we clearly see the benefits of added worm compost in pot 6.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pot 5 and pot 6 are interesting to compare because, &lt;em>to me&lt;/em>, it looks like 50% worm compost seems to produce a worse result than 30% worm compost&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pot 1 (100% homemade compost) is showing another lesson: homemade compost has again won with the best-looking spinach in size even if it didn’t start out well (the onion is showing the sequels…).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Charles points out his homemade compost is not designed for potting, it doesn’t behave like the hare, but rather the tortoise :D&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Why? Because the drainage is not the best, so avoiding it at 100% (despite the price tag) is a good idea.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The roots are pretty nice, even though at the start, the lack of good drainage slow down the growth.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Worm compost, in about 20–25% proportion, can boost your plants and give great results. Higher&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mushroom compost is showing that it would be good for potting, but let it age first. I wish I could say I can buy £50 per ton delivered for it! :O&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moorland Gold potting compost clearly shows it is not made to be used as it was in the trial. The plants must be transplanted in the ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A balance of good drainage and sufficient nutrients is the goal in the end and a slight variation will affect the root system and the health of the plant.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="do-we-need-to-add-anything-for-drainage-in-the-mix-to-grow-vegetables">Do we need to add anything for drainage in the mix to grow vegetables?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We are talking about vermiculite or feeds or amendments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles rarely uses vermiculite: only for lettuce and basil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are making seedlings, starting from a seed, it could make a difference. But at the stage of growth of the picture below, it won’t.&lt;/p>

How much do you spread? The guidelines explained by Charles in a No Dig approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s71f18ila1c">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will look into the misunderstandings and questions about compost and spreading it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-best-time-to-spread-compost">What is the best time to spread compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This question leads to the misunderstanding that nutrients leach out of compost. They don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost isn&amp;rsquo;t fertilizer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost feeds soil life and helps build the mycelia threads beneficial for the soil and plants, like you can see below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They make available the nutrients which sits there insoluble in water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can spread the compost in autumn to please the soil the most. And you can apply the compost around existing crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-much-compost">How much compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles put every year 2.5 cm, but it&amp;rsquo;s close to 2 cm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Putting the compost in the winter benefits the growth of two different crops a year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You will need 4 cubic meters, which equals to 2.4 tons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles details that you don’t spread compost the whole area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the pathways can be covered with woodchips or tiles.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Green waste, that you need to age to yield a good result.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Manure represents food for the soil, but again, try not to use it fresh or use it in a thin layer. It&amp;rsquo;s not technically compost as a fresh product, but becomes one after a year of maturation.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="when-is-compost-ready">When is compost ready&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Three-month-old compost, still steaming, isn&amp;rsquo;t ready to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will know when the temperature isn&amp;rsquo;t high anymore. It will give you better results when using a mature compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, the living organisms in the soil won’t have to perform the heavy work of breaking down the material in the compost and will focus on bringing the nutrients to the plants.&lt;/p>

Charles has been practicing for decades and here, he shares with us how compost can make a difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnoZ4jvrY5g">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I will review the vlogs from Charles about the trays later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you can wait, watch them now:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmWsM7odmkE">My new 60 cells and long life module tray&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK-Gkp_LTPc">New Charles Dowding module trays of 15 and 30 cells&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-grown-in-the-trial">What is grown in the trial&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles is doing the trial using radish and lettuce (batavia type).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="filling-the-trays">Filling the trays&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Don’t be afraid to fill them pretty full, e.g., pressing the compost into the modules so it is dense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Because the modules are small.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="watering">Watering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The initial watering needs to make the trays fully moist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But after that, you don’t need to water daily. A rule would be to water enough so the compost stays humid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The seedlings will require more watering later, as the seedlings grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-will-the-seedlings-be-ready-for-transplanting">When will the seedlings be ready for transplanting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Radish will be ready first, about 2–3 weeks after sowing them in the trays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lettuce will need another week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="week1-updates">Week 1 updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles received some worm compost so he prepared 2 trays:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>one with this worm compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one with the Yorkshire compost to be able to make a proper comparison.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As for the other trays, the progress is already quite significant:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Homemade compost&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All compost did pretty well, overall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can see some differences, with some lettuces lost (not due to compost but more from the seedling used).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, remember that the soil of Charles’s garden is quite rich and fertile. I wonder how in proportion he uses his homemade compost versus the Moorland Gold he buys.&lt;/p>

Start today!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding&amp;rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2scvQgm6HFw">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="when-to-use-one">When to use one&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In small gardens, there may not be space for the 3 bins made of pallets. So, it can be that the plastic model (of about 300 L depending on the model) is your pick.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-get-the-compost-out">How to get the compost out&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Not from the top obviously, since this is where you put your fresh material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The one showcased in the vlog has a bottom opening, but it is not always very practical to get compost out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bin shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a bottom, so simply pull up the bin to see the composting progress.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We can see:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>(1) : that the compost of lacking some water as the edges are quite dry.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>(2) : but some good compost of already available (in the vlog, Charles mentions it is 3-4 months old).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles suggests to water potatoes close to the point of harvest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But how do you know potatoes are close to the point of harvest?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The leaves are turning yellow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The stems are dropping down&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>There is no one perfect timing, but the 2 tips above gives you an idea.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Amazingly, Charles doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to water as of July. But he would need to water if the dry weather continues a few more weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, the climate in Summerset is probably much more humid than the South of France where I live, but that&amp;rsquo;ll need to be tested, because Damien Dekarz said the same thing while cultivating more South of my location the Tarn area.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When the stems looks like the picture above, it is a sign the onions are ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bending of the neck is to help the onions to start drying. It will help for storage later on. You can just pull the onions off the soil and let them dry for a few days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However a little research and you can find that this bacteria isn&amp;rsquo;t really 100% risk-free.

&lt;p>The above image is a pea that you can eat the whole pod and seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But usually, you harvest them when they are dried like the example below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>He puts on a good dose of water every 3 days, in his area. Of course, this will vary from an area to another and it will depend on the weather too.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can see how the stems of the cucumber plants are well trimmed from the ground to about 2 feet up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cucumbers we see above have been sowed on April 15th.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, to get the plant size you see, it needs a lot of water.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-and-seedlings-in-the-greenhouse">Growing and seedlings in the greenhouse&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It seems that the tomatoes do better in terms of leaf quality in the greenhouse because of the smaller temperature difference between night and day than in a polytunnel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it does get hot (Charles had up to 38°C&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cucumbers like the warmth, but one needs to be careful with the seedlings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In regards to melons, if you grow different varieties close to each other, keeping the seeds of the fruits may not produce the same plant the next because hybridization.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles suggests watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/joegardenerTV?app=desktop">Joe Lampl&amp;rsquo;s channel&lt;/a> to know more about tomatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Picking your tomatoes not fully rip take some stress off the plant, which can focus the other fruits, new fruits and the leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And you don&amp;rsquo;t lose flavor from the tomatoes by harvesting them this way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How much and how little compost do you need to grow great vegetables, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/how-much-compost-to-grow-great-vegetables-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/how-much-compost-to-grow-great-vegetables-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-13-how-much--how-little-compost-do-you-need-to-grow-great-vegetables-charles-dowding-hero.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How much and how little compost do you need to grow great vegetables, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Compost is a key element to grow great vegetables. But how much or how little is a question that Charles Dowding will answer for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article represents my notes from his vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding&amp;rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4APqcvo-gqE">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With no dig, you need less compost (this is from 10 years of experience).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But the sure thing is that you will need descent compost. And if you use a good compost, you will need very little, especially with No Dig.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="clarification-of-the-meaning-of-compost">Clarification of the meaning of compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When we talk about compost, we talk about organic material, not fertilizers and synthetic feeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost is anything decomposed. It does not need to be perfect, e.g., it can have some piece of wood.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At first, you may need to buy some compost. But after a while, if you look after your soil, you won&amp;rsquo;t need as much and you can find materials to make your own from local waste.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This time, Charles and his team applied the following trial:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Strip 1: forked with 2-3 cm of compost each year.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The soil is loosened, before applying compost .&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Strip 2: no dig with 2-3 cm of compost each year.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Strip 3: no dig with 2-3 cm of well-rotted cow manure each year.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For strips 1 and 2, the compost is green waste compost purchased combined with homemade compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And here are the yield results in 2014 compared to 2013:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Strip&lt;/th>

&lt;td>3&lt;/td>
&lt;td>61.5 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;td>75.0 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h2 id="progress-of-2015">Progress of 2015&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By that year, the yields went up to 100 kg per strip!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each year, the amount of compost applied is about 3 to 5 cm, spread in February.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The dig bed is more difficult to water (water flows more).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The dig bed has a lot more leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In 9 years,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The dig bed yielded 855 kg of produce.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The no-dig bed yielded 953 kg of produce, &lt;strong>just about 10%&lt;/strong> more.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Again, here, we can take home that the use of compost makes a big difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it is applied once a year in the change of years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is more information about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba0qPjF_wNI">dig vs no dig methods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The most difference between dig and no dig happens in the late spring harvest.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It might feel like a lot of work in the beginning, using a wheelbarrow to bring the compost on the beds, but it is really worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using compost and no dig yield the best result!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We could set the compost material it right on the ground but:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t decompose as fast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get hot as it should&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it will take more space.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So using a compost bin is a good choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-kind-of-bin-and-size">What kind of bin and size?&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="a-plastic-modelhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvb7aa525ow34t203s">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7Aa525oW34&amp;amp;t=203s">A plastic model&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Those that are square-shaped from the stores can hold up to 0.6 meter cube works better on the bare ground but it seems not to be enough to get efficient and hot enough (apparently max of 55°c).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can get a good compost below those temperatures but the weed seeds will be able to sprout again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To kill weed seeds, you need to get to 55°c or above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is, however, not very strong and plastic is a great conductor of heat so the temperatures can&amp;rsquo;t get very high.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-pallet-modelhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvb7aa525ow34t339s">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7Aa525oW34&amp;amp;t=339s">A pallet model&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You just knock out the &amp;ldquo;feet&amp;rdquo; of the pallets. It allows you to save some space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To assemble them easily, use a metal wire at the top and bottom. No screws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a good idea to put cardboard under the bottom of each heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The model of pallet is not necessarily the EURPAL ones but the planks need to be close to each (about 5 cm max). This will help to keep the air flow to a minimum to keep the moisture and also help to keep everything inside the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is fine to put weeds (maybe not brambles ;-))&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using cardboard to cover the sides from inside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So with three bins, for example&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You fill the left one first&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then you start to fill the right one once the left is full.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the left has shrunk half the size, you empty it into the middle one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the right bin is full, you start to fill out the left again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the right has shrunk half the size, you empty it into the middle one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the middle one is 5-6 months old or if the compost is ready, you can empty it and use the compost so that you can start to fill it again from the side bins.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="a-large-wood-structurehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvb7aa525ow34t855s">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7Aa525oW34&amp;amp;t=855s">A large wood structure&lt;/a>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It will cost more because of the amount of wood. But with a large size (1.5 meter cube), the heat goes much higher and therefore, the compost can be ready faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes 5 weeks to fill it with a 4000 m².&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within three months, however, the compost can be ready to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles uses a five-bin structure that obviously requires a lot of wood to build the structure&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ACTION:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Design a two-bin structure to quote it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Find wood to recycle maybe&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="some-generic-tips-and-facts">Some generic tips and facts&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In winter, keep the compost out of the rain so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get too wet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To kill weed seeds, you need to get to 55°c or above.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep the temperatures between 55°c and 70°c but not above to keep the fungal properties of the future compost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To lower the temperatures, add brown material.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A compost should be moist but not too wet to be too smelly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
