Let’s look at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-comfrey">What is comfrey&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Comfrey is a perennial herb that likes to grow in moist soil and in the shade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s native from Europe and Asia and it was introduced into the USA in the 17th century, where it thrives today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its tap root can sometimes reach 3 m in depth. The plant can grow as tall as 1.5 m and 2 m wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s known as a dynamic accumulator, meaning that it mines the minerals and nutrients from the ground and draws it into the leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The root acts like a straw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The leaves are therefore high in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium, which makes it a great liquid feed ingredient.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="usage">Usage&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It’s really easy to grow. You can obtain up to 3 cuts per year to using in mulching, liquid feed, compost ingredients and even as a herbal tea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To feed the soil, comfrey is really good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, to make the liquid feed, you simply need to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cut some leaves and tear them up into a bucket.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>press down the plant and add water to cover the materials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>leave it to ferment for 3 to 4 weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>strain it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dilute it with 1:10 ratio with water before applying it to the vegetables.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can mix the comfrey with stinging nettle, another mineral rich plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a mulch, you will simply apply the raw leave at the bottom of the plant you want to give a boost of nutrients and minerals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="propagation">Propagation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The propagation is easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>At the end of last year, I had little comfrey plants growing near the main plants (very likely from seeds).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I transplanted them in another location in my garden and they’re successfully growing since the spring began.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The other method is to dig out some mature plant and use the roots propagate.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You simply take the roots and cut them into 5 cm long pieces. Then Huw suggests to put them into medium modules to so that they can get started, and then you transplant them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m wondering if simply bearing the piece in the soil doesn’t just work as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The comfrey “bocking 14” variety is especially good at propagation from a small section of roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best time to do this is late spring or early summer.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
