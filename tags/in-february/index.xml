&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We should continue to propagate the shrubs and aromatic plants to multiply them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, if you can afford to buy and plant flower bulbs to increase the diversity on the farm, go for it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="crop-planting-plan">Crop planting plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now is the time to complete the plan for the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to organize the seeds, the tools to be ready when the sowing and planting will start.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That includes finishing the last cleaning of garden space so they’re all ready to receive the crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="harvest-of-winter-crops">Harvest of winter crops&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you did plant winter crops, you will continue getting the crops, weather-permitting, of course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, what you planted in August and September last year could still be available for sale.&lt;/p>

Let&amp;rsquo;s take kale: in February, it’s still producing and it’s a hardy (meaning resistant) and it’s the most profitable crop at this time of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unless you live in a cold climate, where you will need a greenhouse or a polytunnel, then you go for kale next season.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And even if you live in a colder climate, using fleeces (white cover sheet) you can add protection so the crops perform better.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="Be careful of damage to the fleeces" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Be careful of damage to the fleeces&lt;/p>&lt;p>In fact, if your beds are positioned under trees, the falling branches can damage the fleece that is actually no thicker than toilet paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my experience, I think it also depends on the quality of the fleece. I personally use &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3Cwfuoo">this fleece for Winter Garden cover&lt;/a> which I bought already 2 years ago and this year. It holds very well over time.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In the vlog, Moreno harvests carrots sowed during the previous summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="working-with-the-birth-death-cycle-of-nature">Working with the birth-death cycle of nature&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a farmer, you work to extract the most nutrient out of the soil to grow annual crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In nature, the ecosystem would look like what you see in a forest, with trees and perennials. It’s self-sustaining.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of our jobs as annual vegetables grower is to bring fertility to our land so we’re as close as possible to the natural cycle. This is a key way to continue getting predictable and quality yields year after year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-does-work">How does work&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After harvesting the remaining crops and tidying up the beds, you apply a 5 cm layer of compost evenly.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="About not enough broken-down compost" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">About not enough broken-down compost&lt;/p>&lt;p>Moreno showcases a non-mature compost in the vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It contains quite a lot of wood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn’t a problem &lt;strong>as long as it isn’t tilled into the soil&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you apply it on the surface, the roots will go down below that compost while it finishes breaking-down.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using a one-year-old cow manure compost would be much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Moreno, he made a deal with a local farmer owing cows. The farmer sets aside a big pile of cow manure for a year and using a aerating machine, he breaks down the manure into a perfect compost for market gardening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After you applied the compost, you can also firm up the layer with a nice little tool called &lt;em>a bed roller&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woodchip serves 2 roles:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>creating clean and tidy pathways&lt;/li>
&lt;li>feeding the soil as it starts to break down.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It’s an amazing added element to the garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It acts as a sponge for an excess of water and it brings fungi that are an important ingredient to good soil life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a way, it’s like adding a blanket to the soil, protecting the soil underneath from the weather.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, you barely get dirty boots with a woodchip-covered pathway 🌟.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn’t a must to apply woodchips, but you have them available for free or a small cost, definitely use them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="direct-sowing-in-february">Direct sowing in February&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="Be careful: winter ain&amp;#39;t over!" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Be careful: winter ain&amp;#39;t over!&lt;/p>&lt;p>It will depend on where you live, but in a 7B climate, you can still get frost up the first week of May.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It would be a shame to lose early-sowed crops in one cold night.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out the gardening climate using &lt;a href="https://www.gardenia.net/guide/european-hardiness-zones">this link from Gardenia.net&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>So what can you plant?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreno lives in a 7B climate zone and will direct sow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>arugula&lt;/li>
&lt;li>radishes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>turnips&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mustards&lt;/li>
&lt;li>spinach&lt;/li>
&lt;li>kale&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Undercover, you can also plant beets and carrots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an unheated polytunnel, you can also start seedlings for other crops for the Brassicaceae family like cauliflower, broccoli, cabbages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lettuces, fennel or some Swiss shards are also crops you can start seedlings for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, for slow-growing plants, like peppers and eggplants, they need a lot more time to getting start and therefore they will need heat. February is the perfect time to start them if you can afford the cost of heating mat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, count the cost: is it worth the money to grow from scratch those vegetables as you will need to allocate a cozy and protected place in your home?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you have a local farmer handling large number of seedlings for those crops? Maybe prefer buying your plants from him instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="using-a-jang-seeder-for-arugula">Using a jang seeder for arugula&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The jang seeder is a great tool to sow large number of seeds when working on a market garden.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to follow a couple of important steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>pick the right roller for the seeds to plant.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For arugula, you will need the &lt;em>YYG24&lt;/em> plate.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>install the plate into the hopper, which is the case that holds the seeds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>weight the seeds you use to plant the beds to calculate the production cost of the bed and the crop.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>keeping a spreadsheet to record what you use and produce is important for a sustainable market garden. See &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-01/market-gardening-in-january-the-dutch-farmer/#work-on-projects-and-planning">the previous post for details&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To choose the density of sowing for arugula, you will need to choose your goal:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>if you need to grow small leaves, then go for a high density (the 6-row seeder is then a better-suited tool)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if you need to grow larger leaves, then the jang seeder is used.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After sowing, place a fleece into the top of small steel wire hoofs&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Before I begin with Huw&amp;rsquo;s notes, I have to say these are the only vegetables I hate because the smell and taste really put me out. Growing up, we had some (thankfully not too often) but every single time I had to eat some, I almost threw up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know it was what replaced regular potatoes during the last great war, but I&amp;rsquo;d prefer eating wild plants than this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>They’re easy to grow and they grow in the same space year after year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They do spread and unless you have got limited space, it won&amp;rsquo;t become an issue.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s impossible to plant Jerusalem artichoke without digging a trench 30 cm deep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apply a 4 cm layer of well broken-down compost and set each seed 30 cm apart (same for rows).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To eat them, Huw roasts them a pan with salt&amp;hellip; Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s the trick to start liking them?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It can come back on its own if the weather is a little warmer. It will give you an early flourish in may when you transplant them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use the petals as a safran-alternative in cooking or refreshing summer drinks. I wonder &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us3VENwEqNU">how this summer drink is made&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You enjoy them in the late spring and early summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’re easy to grow, hardy and super productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can eat the shoots, meaning the top of the plant that is tender than the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to know that bread bean send out a deep root, so if you sow them in modules, you will deep-cell modules.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Huw grows them in containers to start with. He uses a container of 50 liters so it’s more manageable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He usually plants them in mid-February and the harvest comes, weather dependent, in May or early June.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After harvest, he reuses the compost for beans or squash&lt;/p>
