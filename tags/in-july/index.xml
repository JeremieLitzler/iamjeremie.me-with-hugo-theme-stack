&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgkePmjrX10">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="succession-planting">Succession planting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This method is important to optimize the garden space and always have something growing in all available areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, Huw followed potatoes with leaks in this month of July.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Bouncing of leaks" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Bouncing of leaks&lt;/p>&lt;p>If a leak looks a little bit sad after transplantation, it’s OK. Water them and they will recover shortly.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="harvesting-lettuces">Harvesting lettuces&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Similarly to Charles Dowding, Huw adopted the method to harvest lettuces by picking the outer leaves regularly, which helps to produce a lot more than cutting the salad.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="growing-parsley-under-runner-beans">Growing parsley under runner beans&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Parsley likes shade. What better idea than growing it under runner beans, that climb up high. At least, for Huw, it has been very successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="squashes">Squashes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I agree with Huw about squashes: don’t plan them too packed because all varieties grow and spread a lot. I see that with my volunteer curry pumpkins, that I have been grown from the seeds. I throw in the compost pile the seeds after prepare a dish and, in the past four years, they have work awesomely well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They always produce so much, in my opinion, especially when you know that I only water them during the summer and they produce from 12 to 17 kg of crops per year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, I never get diseases with those volunteer squashes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="no-dig-focus">No Dig focus&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw’s garden was already 95% No Dig in 2021, at the time of the shooting of the vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using &lt;a href="../../../tag/charles-dowding">Charles Dowding&lt;/a> No Dig, he will use organic matter to built up some strong and resilient soil life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been trying out the No Dig also for 3 years. The main challenge is to gather enough organic matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My most successful organic matter is cottonwood dead leaves. They’re small and abundant around my area and last winter, the girls and I picked up 12 trailers (700 liters of volume) and we have got a good amount left still. Worms have found their home in the leftover piles, which is awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use them to cover the bed in winter (about 20 to 30 cm thick layer) and I add some to cover the irrigation pipes in the summer to protect them from the sun.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plug-in-gaps-technique">Plug in gaps technique&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With a no garden plan, you prepare seedlings and fill the gaps in beds, finding a home for everyone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Flowers attract pollinators in the garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, as a message to my future self, grow more. The ladies in the household will appreciate it :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the moment, we have got comfrey, borages, Echinacea, one cosmos flower, self-sown from last year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Just like Huw, I love sweet peas. They taste just awesome, right off the plant, no need to cook them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year, we harvested seeds from pods we let grow big and hopefully, we’ll plant them next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s amazing to harvest your own seed, making your garden resilient as you enter the cycle of self-sufficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d love to find those pink and purple sweet peas that Huw grows. Mine are only white.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tomatoes were planted in between spinach a few months back, always using the space when it’s available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of summer, Charles will draw lines between the tomatoes to grow the next spinach, always having something to grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The takeaway is that you can:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>use the space when available,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>plan to sow and plant using a plan.&lt;/li>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>This year 2023 was my first year to grow garlic and with over 100 cloves planted, we are happy with the green garlic we enjoy in May and June and the dry garlic we’ll enjoy the rest of the summer.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Moreno is quite happy with the multi-crop beds. Remember, he talked about it in &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-03/market-gardening-in-march-the-dutch-farmer/">his March episode&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He shares an interesting fact about soft neck garlic: it can store up to 12 months! The hard neck garlic usually doesn’t store longer than 6 months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you harvested the garlic, you will need to cure them, e.g., clean them for storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is important to remember that to dry them, you shouldn’t set them in direct sunlight, yet they need to be hanging in a ventilated, warm and dry place. It will take 4 to 6 weeks to dry.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Trees provide many benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>extra food&lt;/li>
&lt;li>shade for the crops under them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>help preventing bolting on the spring crops&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It can become more difficult, however, to have fruit trees above market gardening crops, adding more labor to harvest them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So plant your vegetable beds well to make it easier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can see above that Moreno uses as much as possible the available space, planting lettuces or flowers at the bottom of tomatoes or cucumbers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In market gardening, tomatoes have a highly profitable value, even though the work you need to perform more important.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you harvest them, it is important to harvest them not fully ripe; otherwise it will shorten the time you have to sell them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even though you harvest them not fully ripe, they continue to ripen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All this applies to large tomatoes. In fact, the cherry and cocktail types are better harvested fully ripe because they sell more easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>July is the month when harvesting is the focus and it is when you will make most of the year’s revenue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, soon, it will be time to prepare for the fall and winter crops.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Late July Tour of a 100% Organic Kitchen Garden (Only Feed is Compost), by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/late-july-garden-tour-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/late-july-garden-tour-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;p>The garden produces a lot around midsummer.

&lt;p>You can plant tomatoes under the polytunnel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, I grow them without any protection. This year 2022, I haven’t taken care of them and the drought this past summer was really too hard to keep up with the watering.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-else">What else&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The end of July and early August is not only the time of harvest, but also the time to perform a well-planned succession of crops to get the most of the same area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you shouldn’t worry too much about crops rotation because it will save you a lot of hassle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might not be true to all the gardens. You will need to find what works best for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have tomatoes in the same bed for eight years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have planted potatoes randomly (basically, where I had space) and I have very likely planted in the same place again. This year, we even had volunteered potato plants from an area where we had some last year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>July tour of new no dig garden, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/july-tour-of-homeacres-garden-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/july-tour-of-homeacres-garden-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-15-a-pea-pod-with-large-seeds-in-the-hands-of-charles.jpg" alt="Featured image of post July tour of new no dig garden, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Charles Dowding walks through his new no dig garden, talking about harvests, pest covers, compost, watering.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But how do you know potatoes are close to the point of harvest?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The leaves are turning yellow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The stems are dropping down&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Amazingly, Charles doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to water as of July. But he would need to water if the dry weather continues a few more weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, the climate in Summerset is probably much more humid than the South of France where I live, but that&amp;rsquo;ll need to be tested, because Damien Dekarz said the same thing while cultivating more South of my location the Tarn area.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles didn&amp;rsquo;t water the onions by the month of July.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why are onions not watered? Charles waits at the point where it is close to harvest to water them, then getting a nice swell-up of the bulbs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When the stems looks like the picture above, it is a sign the onions are ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bending of the neck is to help the onions to start drying. It will help for storage later on. You can just pull the onions off the soil and let them dry for a few days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However a little research and you can find that this bacteria isn&amp;rsquo;t really 100% risk-free. It can affect the auxiliary insects (bees in particular) if not prepared well and sprayed at the proper time.

&lt;p>You can see how the stems of the cucumber plants are well trimmed from the ground to about 2 feet up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cucumbers we see above have been sowed on April 15th.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, to get the plant size you see, it needs a lot of water.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-and-seedlings-in-the-greenhouse">Growing and seedlings in the greenhouse&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It seems that the tomatoes do better in terms of leaf quality in the greenhouse because of the smaller temperature difference between night and day than in a polytunnel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it does get hot (Charles had up to 38°C&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cucumbers like the warmth, but one needs to be careful with the seedlings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In regards to melons, if you grow different varieties close to each other, keeping the seeds of the fruits may not produce the same plant the next because hybridization.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles suggests watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/joegardenerTV?app=desktop">Joe Lampl&amp;rsquo;s channel&lt;/a> to know more about tomatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Picking your tomatoes not fully rip take some stress off the plant, which can focus the other fruits, new fruits and the leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And you don&amp;rsquo;t lose flavor from the tomatoes by harvesting them this way.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
