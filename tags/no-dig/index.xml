&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A lot of second planting happened already.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tomatoes were planted in between spinach a few months back, always using the space when it’s available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of summer, Charles will draw lines between the tomatoes to grow the next spinach, always having something to grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The takeaway is that you can:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

With a few tips, Charles explains us how to speed up the process to obtain a rich compost material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhBvEG_Pg8Y">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Don’t burry woodchip&lt;/p>&lt;p>Since Charles is the no-dig advocate, he doesn’t bury the woodchips and he warms us that if you dig and burry the woodchips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They will suck the nitrogen out of the rooting zone and it will deprive your plants and vegetables of what they need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the surface, it’s fine because the plants and vegetables will set their root under the woodchips.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>After breaking down a pile of woodchip compost from a bioreactor, you get the following.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Later in the vlog, Charles explains more about the pipes in the bioreactor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s supposed to help maintaining air in the heap. But is it necessary?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woodchip by its natural structure will allow air to be present, hence why we can add it to the compost heap to give the greener material &lt;em>a breath&lt;/em> and prevent sludge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that other bioreactor, Charles added chicken manure and the temperature is consequently higher than the uncovered pile described below.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With fresh fragmented fresh wood (which is what Charles presented, not the dry woodchips), you will get some activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, there is no problem with conifer wood, in Charles’s experience. He feels that the pH level with that kind of wood, once well decomposed, isn’t an issue. I have found that to be true as well for the few years I used them from a source of Douglas wood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, with a pile, you will need to water it if you don’t get enough rain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more green the material you get in the woodchip, the faster they will decompose. It isn’t more true in the summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles used a lawnmower to the breakdown of the woodchips after 4–6 months of winter decomposing.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Green material will decompose faster than the wood pieces, and after 9 months, Charles found out that there are a lot of woodchips left.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I say &lt;em>regular&lt;/em> woodchips, it means with no green, in particular the ones you can get in the sawmill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It decomposes slower, but it will provide some useful materials with time.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="patience-is-key">Patience is key&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can get the woodchip to a pure humus state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you can use water and moisture to speed up the process, you will need significantly more time to decompose woodchips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you reach the humus state, then you have a very good addition for the garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>From what I saw, it seems that the bioreactor setup speed up the decomposition, very likely because you have got a managed structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a pile lying on the ground, you can’t keep the moisture has easily. And watering the pile may use more water than the bioreactor contained environment.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-woodchips">How to use woodchips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles uses woodchips in 4 ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>pathways&lt;/li>
&lt;li>woody material for compost heap (when it’s a few months old and already decomposing)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>burning it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>filling a bed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="pathways">Pathways&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Woodchips on pathways has several advantages :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it keeps your boots clean&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it will eventually provide a source of food for your plants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it helps to keep the soil firm, not compact.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="filling-a-bed-with-2-year-old-woodchips">Filling a bed with 2-year-old woodchips&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To finish, how does it compare to grow vegetables in 2-year-old woodchips “&lt;em>compost&lt;/em>” to regular homemade compost?&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="Big pieces of wood and slugs" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Big pieces of wood and slugs&lt;/p>&lt;p>Be careful of the large wood piece that can shelter slugs…&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What Charles experienced was a very poor start, with a lot of yellow leaves for 6 weeks.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 6 weeks, Charles thinks that the roots got through the layer of woodchips and it ended to be successful, even if less productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Try it yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Try to get the smallest sized woodchips, if you can. But it’s hard to &lt;em>choose&lt;/em> what you get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, use the lawnmower technique.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Winter vegetables in January in years 1 and 10, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-01/winter-vegetables-in-january-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-01/winter-vegetables-in-january-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;p>In January, Charles explains what he does and what grows in his garden.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can use some protection like a meshed tunnel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, with a simple wood structure and a net, you will keep the bird away from the crops you are still harvest from.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles grows peas in January for the shoots, which you can eat in salads.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He planted them in November.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To harvest the shoots, you pick the top and there will be more new shoots coming from the base.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It could produce shoot up until may. It depends on the winter harshness.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swLkA1cHJ4Y">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-compost">What is compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To start off, let’s define compost: it’s the breakdown of organic matter into beautiful rich humus.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-few-key-things-about-lazy-composting">The few key things about lazy composting&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="you-need-bins-of-1-meter-long">You need bins of 1 meter long&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Why? It isn’t going to warm up as easily as in a dalek size bin. It needs a larger size bin to be able to build up the warmth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That warmth and heat help to break down the material.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-ingredients">The ingredients&lt;/h3>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will typically add:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>green material: grass, vegetable waste, coffee ground…&lt;/li>
&lt;li>brown material: dead leaves, wood, cardboard…&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="About grass clipping" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">About grass clipping&lt;/p>&lt;p>Apply it in a thin layer (2–3 cm maximum) because it can get sludgy if too thick.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I have found that mixing grass clippings with wood dust helps build a thin compost and helps to avoid the sludge.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="ratio-of-green-and-brown">Ratio of green and brown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw tries to go for a 1 part green for 2 parts brown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, with lazy composting, he doesn’t overthink it. &lt;strong>But you will need to &lt;em>follow one key rule&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="you-need-diversity">You need diversity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Two or three ingredients aren’t enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more you add diverse sources of material, the more balance the compost will be in terms of pH and nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-a-bin-is-full">When a bin is full&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The only thing to do: press on the material to compact it a little.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put on some boots, climb in the bin and jump!&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="Jumping in the compost bin" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Jumping in the compost bin&lt;/p>&lt;p>Don’t do it if you didn’t build a strong structure 🤣&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Finally, cover the compost with cardboard to keep some rainfall off the compost pile. You want moisture but you don’t have anaerobic environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-is-lazy-compost-ready">When is lazy compost ready&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It will take longer, because it doesn’t get as hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead, two to three months, it will take between six and eight months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw uses the technique of smelling the compost: if it smells like the forest floor, then it’s ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you can apply it to the beds as a cover for winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-rats">What about rats&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will get rats if you put in cooked food, diaries and bread in the compost bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And wouldn’t you prefer having them in the compost bin or your food storage?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-many-compost-bins">How many compost bins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Three bins appears to be a good target:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>one is usable for the garden&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one is full and is starting to break down&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one is being filled&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Therefore you will have compost available most of the time!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spring: sowing and planting into surface compost outside, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/spring-sowing-and-planting-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/spring-sowing-and-planting-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;p>When spring comes, it’s time to sow and plant your new crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZs17nwxgtg">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="before-you-sow">Before you sow&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You have applied compost on your beds with compost in the beginning of the past winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, before you sow your seeds, use a rake to break up the remaining lumps of compost to create a nice smooth surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use your feet to break any lumps. Walking on a compost bed is fine because it needs to be firm and you can’t compact compost by walking on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sowing-carrots-with-radish">Sowing carrots with radish&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Draw lines with a wood stick (if you don’t own &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=triangular&amp;#43;hoe">a triangular hoe&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Make them not too deep (about 3-4 cm).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sowing in compost is absolutely fine, unlike some may say.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Radish tip" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Radish tip&lt;/p>&lt;p>If you sow your radishes with your carrots, you will know where the carrots are. The first sprout very quickly while the latter take more time to come up.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Finish the sowing with covering the lines drawn with compost and walk on the lines to firm the compost once again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="planting-seedlings-grown-in-modules">Planting seedlings grown in modules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The tool to perform the task is a spade handle which has a slightly pointed and round extremity that is perfect to make holes in the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can create your own with a tree branch or an old space handle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The width of the handle or branch should be about the same as the modules you’re going to plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To plant lettuce, use a spacing of 25 cm so that you can let them grow big.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles picks up the outer leaves to eat for a long period of time. It provides a lot of food from the same plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you plant the seedlings, set them deep so they’re sturdier.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="fill-the-tray-with-compost">Fill the tray with compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Use a fine compost will make it easier to fit the compost in the small module cells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Follow those steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>pour the compost in the cells&lt;/li>
&lt;li>push down with your fingers on the compost into the cells
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it will hold more moisture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the compost will hold together better when you prick out the seedling&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>create little holes where you will drop the seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-deep-should-you-sow">How deep should you sow&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s best not to sow to deep (no more than 2 cm) so the seeds can come out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="peas">Peas&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Put 2 or 3 seeds per cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Push the peas a little bit deeper than the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="radish">Radish&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Put 4 or 5 seeds per cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more you put in each cell, the smaller the radishes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="beetroot">Beetroot&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Put 4 or 5 seeds per cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s hard to sow beetroot direct because the seedlings are prone to pest attack.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you have grown them in modules, they tend to resist better.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="onion">Onion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For onions, put about 6 seeds per cell. For spring onions, put 2 more per cell.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cover with compost the holes and firm it before watering well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This system is applying to more people than Charles’s huge compost heap I have taken not about. See my other notes on the matter using the &lt;a href="../../../tag/compost/">&lt;em>Compost&lt;/em> tag&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-brief-explanation-of-the-system">A brief explanation of the system&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles simply uses wood pallets, from which he knocks off the bottom to make them more lightweight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then he attaches the sides with a wire at each top and bottom corners.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="how-long-does-it-take-to-fill-the-heaps">How long does it take to fill the heaps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For Charles, it takes two months with his large garden (one and a half acres).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might take less for you. Hence, you will need to adjust the size of the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>For example, I don’t produce nor possess enough material to fill a heap made of full-sized pallets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I made one from half of a pallet and I will see if I need bigger or not as I manage to gather more material.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="turning-the-compost">Turning the compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You don’t need to turn it often. Save yourself some energy!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles does it once in the lifecycle of compost making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the presented heap system, you only need to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>remove the wires from one side (see &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3gAwfzy0qLw?t=190">at 3:10 in the vlog&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and use a manure fork to turn the compost from one heap to the neighbor (see &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3gAwfzy0qLw?t=200">at 3:20 in the vlog&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The manure fork is easier to use than a digging fork. Buy one! If you can, look at the place where they sell second-hand items. I have found mine for 3 euros that way!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a three-bay structure, you take the content of the side heaps into the middle one.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Turning depends on how long it takes to fill the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m sure how long you have to wait, but let’s take this simple example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Degradation is visible when the content level of the heap decreases. If you fill full your heap, turn it when it’s half full.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you simply follow levels in a given to know when to turn into the middle.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the moisture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the heat&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Why would you want to do that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you put a huge layer of grass clippings, for example, as it degrades, it might rot and air might not be sufficiently present.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles provides a concrete example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>set a 7 cm layer of grass clippings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>then set a 2 cm layer of dead leaves or paper or cardboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In terms of volume, you put more green material than brown material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, in terms of dry matter, it represents 50/50 ratio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, even the green vegetable waste like courgette leaves contains:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the leaf itself (green material)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the stem (more brown, even if it looks green ;))&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="about-weeds-and-seeds">About weeds and seeds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can put them on: bindweed, couch grass, flower seeds. Just put them in the middle and cover them well and they won’t reproduce!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Heat provides what you need to kill the weeds and the seeds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this temperature range, you retain the fungi activity that is very important too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get a hot compost, you need nitrogen-rich material, aka &lt;em>green material&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Fresh leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grass&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kitchen and food waste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fresh manure, either cow or horse&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coffee grounds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If the heat does go to high, you simply add more brown material.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-the-size-of-brown-material">What about the size of brown material&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Why? It brings too much air in the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The typical brown materials, aka carbon-rich materials are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Small piece of woody material&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Old or dried tree leaves&lt;/li>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">How do you know you need water and how much do you need?&lt;/p>&lt;p>Well, it’s something you need to assess from your personal circumstances: weather, material you put in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the early stage, you decide based on how it looks and feels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later, when the material has degraded enough, use the &lt;em>squeeze technique&lt;/em> described in &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/compost-from-clippings-and-other-waste-charles-dowding/#consistency-of-the-compost">this article&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf6CGj7xpFE">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even in winter, you can do it, so let’s look at how and what.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-compost">What can you compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Well, almost anything with no plastic, industrial wax.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost heaps are amazing alchemical processes that degrade pretty much everything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Putting citrus on the heap isn’t popular or even it isn&amp;rsquo;t recommended. Yet, Charles composts them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kitchen waste is usually more &lt;em>green&lt;/em> material than &lt;em>brown&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wood ash to the contrary is very much a &lt;em>brown&lt;/em> material.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Charles recommends to put it on the heap rather than directly on the garden beds to use the full potential of the potass as it’s transformed in the heap.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stacks of vegetables (like cabbage) need to be cut into small pieces.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The goal is to maximize the surface area that the bacteria will use to degrade the material.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fresh shredded wood is similar and is a woodier material.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coffee ground isn’t compost until you put it on the heap.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It’s considered a green material.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also, it isn’t acidic, as some say. Yet, the numbers say that the pH is 6.8 on average.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vegetable leaves, especially when they turn yellow.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Leaves turning yellow stop contributing to the plant’s development and, as they fall, the slugs will get involved. You don’t want that to happen.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Weeds are scary, but when you can compost it.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When you pull the weeds, you will get the brown from the soil that will come with it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Also, popular belief says not to compost perennial weeds. If you continually add material to the heap, the roots of weeds you pulled will die.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The heat will speed the process to kill them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Straw, if you have an organic&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles simply says to balance material with half green and half brown.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="winter-compost-versus-summer-compost">Winter compost versus Summer compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The summer brings more green material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the winter, the brown material dominates more.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles layers the material on the heap and you find air thanks to the brown material to help the green material to degrade.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="heat-in-the-compost-heap">Heat in the compost heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can make cool compost, heat isn’t a requirement but it speeds the transformation of the materials into compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Between 55 °C and 70 °C, you have what it needs to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>kill weed seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>create a good environment for bateria and fungi&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-know-the-heap-is-finished">How do you know the heap is finished&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Or in other words, when do you know you need to fill up another heap?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can go on a long time if you don’t add a lot frequently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s when the sizing of the bay is important: it’s better to have a smaller bay that you fill quickly than a bay too large that never gets filled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles’s three-quarter of an acre garden provides a lot of materials. He fills his six large bays (1.5 m by 1.5 m) easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of his bays can contain one ton of compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He turns the compost once from the filled bay into the neighbor bay.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-options-for-container">What options for container&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you can’t build a structure as big as Charles or if you don’t need so a large structure, use wood pallets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You just need to cover the sides with cardboard to keep the moisture.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If no more than two drops fall off your hands, the moisture is a good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Don’t just use the look of the compost to judge the moisture levels&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-the-color">What about the color&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A dark brown is better than a jet black concerning compost’s color.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Green waste compost is often very black because it was very hot and it might not be a good news. The level of microbes and micro-organisms is probably low.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well-rotted cow manure can make nice compost and it’s less dark than the green waste compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the homemade compost with a very good balance of green and brown gives a lighter shade of brown compared to the cow manure compost.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="turning-compost">Turning compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Its purpose is to introduce new air in the compost and one doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to perform the task regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, when the heap is full and of a brown color, you can turn it into another heap, like Charles does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turning is also the occasion to break down the lumps.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turned compost is left alone for another few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sifting the compost isn’t a must. When you want to use it for your potting, then sifting is necessary for obvious reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="myths-of-compost">Myths of compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The following myths are more annoying than anything else:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Separating materials that are said not to go on the heap (ex: root of perennial weeds, citrus)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Instead, cover them well so they can grow in the heap and you will be fine.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diseased vegetable leaves
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The diseases, like blight, can’t survive without a living host&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heat is a must
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No, like I wrote above, it’s a bonus. You can make a great compost with no heat.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;li>when you get the compost before the new year, the compost will become smooth, ready to be sown in the spring.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFqHe9qqZwU">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In early summer, everything is growing fast. So you need to be present and be on the lookout.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="weeding">Weeding&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even if the No Dig method with cardboard works efficiently, the weeds don’t die out right away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to watch for them to come out here and there for a few months or even a couple of years after applying the cardboard and compost layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sure thing is that you won’t get as much, so it’s reducing the work performed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tidying-up-the-garden">Tidying up the garden&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Interestingly, Charles tells us that the slugs like the old leaves of vegetables the most, kind of like they tidy up the place by eating what we won’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They have a role, they aren’t just there to annoy the gardener.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here, we learn that to keep the slug away, clean the vegetables from old leaves. I’m interested to see how I can put this into action next spring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="succession-cropping">Succession cropping&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In early summer, some vegetables near readiness for harvest, you will be able to replace the old crops with new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sowing in module trays the next crops in advance is key to maximize the growing seasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, you can sow beetroots in modules, 4 weeks before you harvest cabbages, so that they’re ready to plant right after the cabbage harvest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another example is replacing broad beans with cabbage in the beginning of summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-can-you-sow-in-the-beginning-of-june-in-the-uk">What can you sow in the beginning of June in the UK&lt;/h2>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Boltardy beetroot" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Boltardy beetroot&lt;/p>&lt;p>It’s a fast-growing variety and it can be used for early sowing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beetroots are sown in pockets of about 4 seeds, remembering that some seeds won’t germinate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles thins the seedlings down to 4 beetroots per module.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Spring onions" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Spring onions&lt;/p>&lt;p>They’re sown in pockets of about 8–10 seeds per module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spring onions are very versatile because you can eat them when they’re small, or let them grow into bulbs.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Gowrie swede" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Gowrie swede&lt;/p>&lt;p>They’re sown in pockets of about 2–3 seeds per module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, you will need to thin to one root.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What else? In mid to late spring, Charles sowed the following, which are ready to be planted in the beginning of June:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Red cabbage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kale&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leak&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Brussels sprouts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Runner beans&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cucumber&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="growing-seedlings">Growing seedlings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>They will need warmth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In early summer, it’s easy to have warmth, but for Charles in the UK, he puts his seedling in the greenhouse, watering them every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="more-about-spring-onions-that-grew-during-the-winter">More about spring onions that grew during the winter&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles planted the spring onions below last August.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to eat them, you need to watch out the seed head, unless you want to harvest seeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A spring onion will turn a bit woody if left too long in the ground with the seed head growing.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="planting-leaks-while-clearing-space">Planting leaks while clearing space&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles clears out some kohlrabi sown in February, planted early April with a net on to prevent cabbage root flies to attack them.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="About cabbage root flies" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">About cabbage root flies&lt;/p>&lt;p>Charles doesn’t have a solution against the cabbage root flies except for the net over it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He talked about another technique, but people have reported it doesn’t work.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Then, you will need to remove any weed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also walk on the bed, especially after harvesting kohlrabi or anything with big roots to firm the compost again.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Remember" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Remember&lt;/p>&lt;p>Walking on your bed covered with compost, you can’t compact it. You’ll firm it.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>In summer, you will need to water the compost if dry.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="Why not make your bed too mounded" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Why not make your bed too mounded&lt;/p>&lt;p>When you pour water on it, even with a soil covered with compost, the water will run off to the sides.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you want the bed to be leveled. It’s easier to water and keep the moisture on the bed.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>After you watered maybe a second time, you’re ready to plan the leaks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want a longer white stem, you need to plan them deep.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="intersow-a-new-crop-with-another-growing">Intersow a new crop with another growing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Why would you do that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Often, you will run out of space to sow the next crop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it’s possible if you intersow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, Charles is sowing carrots between lettuce.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to water well on the inside of the trench only so it’s efficient in water usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Tip" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Tip&lt;/p>&lt;p>Wait a little bit before sowing the seeds, just like for the leeks earlier.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Sowing carrots requires precision. You don’t want too many sown in the same space. It’s always possible to thin them. But you could also save seeds by sowing just what you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles advices to sow one or two seeds every centimeter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, after putting back the compost over the seeds, walk on the compost to firm it up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You don’t need to water more if you followed the watering of the trench at the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="timing-of-planting">Timing of planting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can easily plant too early. So learn about your climate and when it’s best to plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Curry squash and climbing bean need warmth so planting in late may to early June for zone 8 in the UK&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In contrast, broad beans (&lt;em>fève&lt;/em> in French) are planted in November to December.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You have probably seen the structure of growing beans on a wall-like structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It tends to weaken against the wind, while tippees show more sturdiness, as they diffuse the wind coming onto them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about-watering">About watering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Watering well when planting is key. Use a good amount to make the soil really moist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, don’t water them for a while, the plants will then need to make their roots down, looking for water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it isn’t the case for lettuce. The vegetables you harvest regularly need watering the most.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coriander, spinach, peas fall in that category as well. Always depending on your weather, watering once every 2–3 days is enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With compost, it slowly releases the water to the plants, as it acts as a sponge&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Where I live in Ardèche, I do also water every other day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most difficult time is when the sun literally burns everything like this past summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So think about shading. It doesn’t have to block all the sun, but it will help tremendously to keep your crops alive.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="reminders-about-compost">Reminders about compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You need to give air to the compost, using a &lt;em>compost mixer&lt;/em> tool, like &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3WZKFRS">this one&lt;/a> that I use for two years now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I sue the technique of filling out my heaps in layers with green and brown. The green comes from the kitchen waste I throw away (5 liters per day) and the brown comes from dead leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can put weeds in the compost, but you will need heat. A big heap allows you to build up sufficient heat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep your compost covered, the worms will thank you for that as they like dark and moist.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i7yAYenaQk">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article provides you a summary of the trial Charles conducted to compare two composts to grow the same vegetables.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-trial-setup">The trial setup&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles compares two composts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mushroom compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Composted cow manure&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Mushroom compost contains more nutrients than regular green waste compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Animal manure compost depends on the type of bedding that they were on.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-results">The results&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On the strip with mushroom compost, the yields over 3 years were the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Composted cow manure&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Mushroom compost&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>229.26 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;td>251.94 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>You would have thought that cow manure would have produced more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="in-detail">In detail&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>No carrots grew up in the bed covered with cow manure compost. See &lt;a href="#why-those-results">below why&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Potatoes, lettuce and chicory yielded a similar amount.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leeks and cabbages looked better in the cow manure compost. However, in that same compost, Charles feels like the broad beans note yielding as much as the other compost (mushroom compost), in the same area, may have left more nutrients for the next vegetables.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chinese cabbages aren’t doing well in the cow manure, for the same reason as the carrots.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Squashes yielded more crops in the mushroom compost.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="why-those-results">Why those results&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Simply put: the little bit of straw brings snails and slugs eating crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="personal-comments-on-straw">Personal comments on straw&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I have found that straw helps to retain moisture. But autumn leaves provided me with a better result.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also leaves keep the badgers away, or at least they don’t attract them as the straw does. Two years ago, I had replanted peas three times because the badgers came to plow the garden!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year, with leaves, they still came, but a lot fewer times.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Discover the problems when you plant in fresh manure rather than compost, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/discover-the-problems-manure-vs-compost-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/discover-the-problems-manure-vs-compost-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-10-discover-the-problems-when-you-plant-in-fresh-manure-rather-than-compost-charles-dowding.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Discover the problems when you plant in fresh manure rather than compost, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>The best way to discover something is to try them out! Charles shares an example in this vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veHKCN73tUc">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A guy contacted him about using fresh manure as a great way to grow potatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So Charles decided to try also.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-take-out-of-using-fresh-horse-manure">The take out of using fresh horse manure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>He sees a lot of weeds growing, in addition to the nice vegetables. I had the same experience where common purslane grew a lot after applying fresh manure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the great news, it’s easy to remove those weeds from the hay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tells us how efficient a proper composting process, e.g., getting the temperatures up, is to kill weed seeds.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to add regularly material onto the heap and in the proper proportion of green and brown, e.g., in a 50/50 ratio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in fresh manure, vegetables can grow. But so the weeds in the hay ;)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pyralid weedkillers in compost, explained by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/pyralid-weedkillers-in-compost-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/pyralid-weedkillers-in-compost-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-09-pyralid-weedkillers-in-compost-amino-and-clopyralid-effects-and-healing-charles-dowding.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Pyralid weedkillers in compost, explained by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Charles talks about aminopyralid weedkiller in his compost because residues were present in the hay and horse manure used to make the compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2D1idnMNKng">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It doesn’t affect the grass family, which I find amazing when we’re talking about a &lt;strong>weed&lt;/strong>killer…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It doesn’t affect the Brassicaceae family (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbages…)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the peas and broad beans are really diseased. But also, tomatoes, strawberries and lettuces will go yellow…&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s generally accepted that the trial to understand the effects of weedkillers on plants isn’t conducted well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A bioassay reveals the effects for the plant to assimilate the nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A bioassay is a measurement of the concentration or potency of a substance by its effect on living cells or tissues.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This technique will tell you if the poison is present in the plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the image above, Charles thinks the concentration isn’t very high in his trial but it’s definitely present…&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-is-present">Where is present&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Often, it’s present in horse manure, but also you can find it in cow manure or hay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even a 10-year-old manure will contain it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-heal-the-contaminated-soil">How to heal the contaminated soil&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will need about 10 days of warm days and enough watering to break down the compounds in aminopyralid weedkiller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s the soil life that will break down the poisons.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>How does Charles know that? A consultant of the company came down to explain it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He told him he thought it was manganese deficiency and that the company didn’t get a lot of notifications about issues with their poison… I’m sure that has changed with Charles’s warnings in this vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles thinks and hopes that growth will improve, but he suggests to wait another year to grow plants in the same area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, for UK citizens, you can report the problems in manure to &lt;a href="https://www.corteva.co.uk/manure-matters.html">this website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, be careful!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No dig: less compost to grow great plants, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/no-dig-less-compost-great-plants-clean-soil-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/no-dig-less-compost-great-plants-clean-soil-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-08-no-dig--using-less-compost-to-grow-great-plants-and-have-clean-soil-charles-dowding-hero.jpg" alt="Featured image of post No dig: less compost to grow great plants, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Starting &amp;ldquo;No Dig&amp;rdquo; doesn’t necessarily mean requiring loads of compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC6OBOyQ0mY">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost is a great entry point to grow a lot of vegetables in a small area. Also, compost provides the nutrition to the plants to provide a good harvest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="no-dig-around-trees">No dig around trees&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To help the development of the apple tree’s roots, Charles applied his nO Dig technique around apple trees.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As Charles tells us often, you don’t need to wait much before planting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="no-dig-loosens-the-soil">No Dig loosens the soil&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With the No Dig method and using compost, the soil is already loose.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How? With all the dead weed roots left in the soil, you find out that air is present and the compost in coming feed the life thriving. Your vegetables therefore benefit from all that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the scenario that Charles showcased in the vlog, I’d say he uses about 2 to 3 cm of compost on top of the usual cardboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When it comes to grow a lot more vegetables, you will need more compost indeed. However, because you need less ground to grow your vegetables, you will need less compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-plan">My plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’m planning to purchase about a ton of &lt;em>green compost&lt;/em> to go further into the No Dig method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, I’ll need to pay 26 euros per ton, but transportation and accessibility to my property require that I rent a truck for 75 euros for half a day…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One ton of that compost will equal to 2000 liters. The equivalent surface area represents 20 m² with a 10 cm layer of compost. It feels like nothing, but a bed of 2 meters by 10 meters provides a lot of places to grow vegetables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then remember that the vegetables you grow will produce waste that you can compost to make your own compost.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Start Out No Dig, a method with cardboard and compost, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/starting-no-dig-with-cardboard-and-compost-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/starting-no-dig-with-cardboard-and-compost-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-07-a-basket-of-vegetables.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Start Out No Dig, a method with cardboard and compost, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>In this vlog, Charles explains how to start No Dig.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LH6-w57Slw">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="definition-of-mulch">Definition of mulch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Mulch can be anything that covers the surface you apply it to keep the light out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-to-start-the-no-dig-bed">Where to start the No Dig bed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A very weedy area, a lawn are good candidates for a no dig bed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-do-you-need">What do you need&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will need:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cardboard, because it’s the cheapest covering material&lt;/li>
&lt;li>wool&lt;/li>
&lt;li>compost&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you don’t have any weed, you’re rare lucky person. Most of us will start from a weedy patch of land.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the following notes, we will see how Charles will free us so much time in our gardening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Weeding bores and tires you and all the time used to weed isn’t the time to grow strong and healthy vegetables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And Charles’s method leaves the soil undisturbed, which is essential for a life-rich soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weeds aren’t pulled, they stay there and eventually, they give up growing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles put it nicely: if you try to dig out the weed, they will be hurt but they will have &lt;em>the will to grow more&lt;/em> and you will harm your soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="about-the-cardboard">About the cardboard&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can find it easily for free. But:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>use a brown cardboard, not the shiny ones that contain plastic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>remove the tape and staples, if any&lt;/li>
&lt;li>avoid cardboard with ink, unless you’re sure it’s vegetable-based ink.&lt;/li>

&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-first-application">The first application&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You will need to delimit your bed area and the pathways.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then apply a layer of cardboard over it, making sure no gap exists that will let the weeds through. Indeed, the weeds will find their way if you’re wary about the cardboard position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s important to make sure the cardboard overlap generously to prevent light to reach the craving weeds underneath.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-compost-to-use">What compost to use&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Fresh manure isn’t recommended. Even well-rotted cow manure doesn’t perform as well as his homemade compost, Charles finds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember the goal is to be able to sow in straight away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Green waste compost: it comes from general garden waste, debris, prunings, etc.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This compost usually has a darker color and its performance isn’t quite as good as homemade compost&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Homemade compost: it comes from general garden waste, fibers, prunings, wood, etc.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It doesn’t look as fine as the green waste compost. Also, you don’t need to sift it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Mushroom compost: it needs to be well decomposed. Charles didn’t say much about how it’s made, so I ask in the vlog’s comments section.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Spread a 10 cm layer of compost on top of the cardboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don’t hesitate to firm the compost with your feet. It does need firmness, not loose nor compact. But the great thing about compost is that it’s never compact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To contain the compost in the bedding area, you can use wood framing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issue that can arise is getting hold of a lot of compost. It’s difficult, but read in my other notes I took from Charles’s videos on the topic of compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to hunt for the materials in your neighborhood. It will surprise you how much waste people will be delighted to give away for free.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pathways-around-the-beds">Pathways around the beds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The easiest and cheapest way to do it’s to use woodchips, decomposed or not, it will feed the soil life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They will dig for you but in a much more gentle manner, keeping the carbon dioxide in the ground, whereas when you dig, you release carbon dioxide…&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="maintain-an-edge">Maintain an edge&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>An edge is anything that covers about 20 cm extra more space than your bed is taking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will help to keep the grass to jump the rich soil of your bed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use small wood beams and cardboard as shown below.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="you-need-up-to-three-or-four-cardboard-applications">You need up to three or four cardboard applications&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>When the weeds start to grow through the first layer of cardboard on the pathways, it’s time to pull the weeds, if it’s easy, and apply another layer of cardboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Always make sure to overlap the piece of cardboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to apply each layer about every six weeks unless the weeds have died.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="tire-the-weeds-by-removing-the-small-shoots">Tire the weeds by removing the small shoots&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It’s possible to remove all weeds with time and patience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Patrol around the garden where you put the cardboard, pull out the young shoots of weeds and the parent root will die at one point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It can take a few years, however, to tire some of the strongest weeds like the bindweeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s achievable and you need to be patient.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="using-soil-on-a-new-bed">Using soil on a new bed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles doesn’t use soil when he builds a new bed because vegetables grow much better in compost.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles recommends not to sow directly in the ground because it’s vulnerable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Propagation means sowing the seed or multi-sown seeds in a module until the seedling is big enough to be transplanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles has severable vlogs on the topics, check out the &lt;em>propagation&lt;/em> tag. &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/comparing-different-composts-for-propagation-charles-dowding/">These notes are a good starting point&lt;/a> from a more recent vlog.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The demonstration (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0LH6-w57Slw?t=1250">available at minute 20:50 in the vlog&lt;/a>) above showcases how simple it is, requiring no tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About spacing, Charles suggests 30 cm between each plant for beetroots. I’ve come across many vlogs so far on spacing. But I will certainly do, check out the tags when you read this, I may have a tag &lt;em>Spacing seedlings&lt;/em> or something similar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, remember that you will be able to do succession planting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>planting lettuce after the peas,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>planting beetroots after the spring onions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>etc.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="a-comment-about-a-few-vegetables">A comment about a few vegetables&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Root vegetables transplant well, unlike you may have heard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, where does this belief come from? Is it because of the dig method not working well showing? Isn&amp;rsquo;t the problem in the action of transplanting but rather because of the method used to grow the vegetables?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, birds tend to eat broccoli, so you’ll need to protect them with nets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kale is a great vegetable, to be sown in May and transplanted in June. It will give you food in the winter months and even early spring.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Keep thinking ahead, have seedlings ready for the months to come, even if it’s winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You want to keep eating from your garden all year long ultimately.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to start small, though. I took notes on the topic in a vlog by Huw Richards. He explains &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/the-simple-way-to-food-self-sufficiency-huw-richards/">the simple way to becoming self-sufficient in food&lt;/a>. Have a read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about the storage of your vegetables. Garlic and onions harvested in the summer will stay indoors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, eating home-grown produce is also great for you because it contains a lot of microbes very beneficial to your digestive track.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding&amp;rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeBUX9iEFwg">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s worth spending time making some decent compost because it has a multiplier effect all the way along down the line.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="heap-location">Heap location&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s very convenient when you&amp;rsquo;ve got your heat reasonably central, because then it&amp;rsquo;s less time needed for bringing stuff to the beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In No Dig gardening, it is the main input of time: applying the compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-makes-great-compost">What makes great compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, you&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed some heat in your compost: it is the batteria at work, especially when you have got a lot of green in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, the fungis are important as well. They don&amp;rsquo;t like it too hot, hence, not going above 70 °C is important to them alive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, a good balance of green materials and brown materials added in the heap in layers to help the decomposition to happen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on your location and weather, you will want to avoid the heap to be under the rain, if you receive as much rain as Charles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Covering the heap will be necessary then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, putting in fibery materials like stems, paper or cardboard will help to bring some air after mixing it in the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-is-it-ready">When is it ready&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Well, that depends on your condition and the following checklist:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>is it still warm?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>has it been turned?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>has it been decomposing for 6 months at least?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>is there any worm?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Then you can go ahead.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, it will depend on how much heat you were able to have. The more you heat the compost (staying under 70 °C for the fungal activity), the fastest the compost will be ready to use.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Compost is balancing green &amp; brown, with Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/compost-making-balancing-nitrogen-and-carbon-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/compost-making-balancing-nitrogen-and-carbon-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-04-aerial-view-of-charles-garden-as-he-walks-to-the-compost-heap.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Compost is balancing green &amp; brown, with Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Successful compost can be summarized by a good a good balance of green or brown. Let&amp;rsquo;s review the must-know with Charles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtMsEylZvqw">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s difficult to look at it too scientifically about it and the quantity of the materials one is adding vary all the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No two gardens are the same. So the materials you will have won’t be the same as Charles or I add.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’ll be perhaps broadly similar but you will always find subtle differences. So don’t worry too much about being precise.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ratio-of-green-and-brown">Ratio of green and brown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The mix of green and brown should be at least half green and half brown. But what is green and what is brown?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="comment-about-carbon-to-nitrogen-balance">Comment about carbon to nitrogen balance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s often talked about in books. And it confuses things because the proportion given is two parts of carbon to one part of nitrogen. So it’s more a ratio of 33% green to 66% of brown. Very few things are pure green and similarly to brown material.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="definition-of-green">Definition of green&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What is &lt;em>mostly&lt;/em> green? Here is a sample list:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>All fresh leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Vegetable peels&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kitchen waste&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Weed leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Young tree leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fresh manure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Coffee grounds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Urine&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="definition-of-brown">Definition of brown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What is &lt;em>mostly&lt;/em> brown? Here is a sample list:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Woody materials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Old stems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prunings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dry tree leaves&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Cardboard&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-ok-to-put-diseases-material-on-the-compost-heap">What is OK to put diseases material on the compost heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s OK to put on vegetable leaves with mildew, for example. For Charles, it doesn’t cause a problem to the finished product. He has used blighted potatoes leaves, rust of garlic or leeks and all went in the heap. For the case of blight, the disease needs living tissues and when the waste green of the plant goes on the heap, the disease will no longer persist.&lt;/p>

You can put seed on the heap, but put it in the middle where you get the most heat, warranting to kill the seeds. You can put on thistle in as well. A lot of myths, generally accepted, exist about what can&amp;rsquo;t and what can be put in the heap.&lt;/p>

We don’t see very clearly the brown layers, but it’s there in the ratio stated above. We can see a lot of vegetable stems that contain more &lt;em>brown&lt;/em> than green leaves. Also depending on seasons, you will have available a various amounts of green and brown. Spring is the height of the green season. Summer is a bit more balanced green and brown And then autumn is more brown material and finally winter is very brown.

So you’ve got different seasons, you have different materials.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-build-a-heap-at-all">Why build a heap at all&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A heap will hold the materials, it will hold the heat and it will make it tidier. Also, Charles has a lot of solids and it’s often said that a compost heat should have slated sides to allow some passenger in (insects, small animals, etc.). Air is a vital ingredient in compost making because that is what bacteria breathe on to live and multiply. And they do a lot of the breakdown: they’re what brings the heat in the heap. The brown material, especially larger pieces, will allow to have more air in the heap, helping the battery to do their job.

You would ask: why use solid sides to build a heap? Charles explains that it helps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>retain the heat and moisture better&lt;/li>
&lt;li>slatted sides don’t allow a worthwhile amount of air in. They are lined inside with cardboard, so no air enters, moisture and warmth are retained as explained &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3gAwfzy0qLw">in this vlog&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="store-brown">Store brown&lt;/h2>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> Expand Down
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>During spring and summer, you have less brown available. So store away leaves, for example. I’m currently _harvest&lt;em>ing dead leaves, literally all I can get in my neighborhood. I will probably build some kind of heap just for the leaves so I can _sprinkle&lt;/em> them into my compost in the making.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="point-about-weed-roots">Point about weed roots&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Bindweeds are big trouble for the gardeners. I know I have got a lot. Charles isn’t afraid to say that putting in even the roots in the heap is OK. And these roots aren’t indestructible. We give them too much credit. They seem invincible, but they’re not A weed root has only so much energy, so if you can keep it away from the light while it’ll try to grow, it’ll do so or it gets too hot and die from that. And as it tries to grow, it’s using up its energy and it withers at the end. Of course, don’t just put a lot on the heap and leave them to grow. So:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cover them&lt;/li>
&lt;li>put them in the middle of the heap and heat will take care of them It’s the same for couch grass, perennial thistles.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="sizing-your-heap">Sizing your heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you’re like Charles, you could replicate on 1.5 m by 1.5 m heap structure, but you will need 3000 m² of land with a sizable vegetable garden and the lawn and edges. Otherwise, you need to find out your size by starting small. I don’t have a large garden nor access to lots of material. I would suggest to start with Charles’s pallets heap structure that are cheaper to make and smaller. And even if it’s still too big, cut pallets in half. That’s what I’m doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finding-material-if-you-cant-produce-enough">Finding material if you can’t produce enough&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Like I said above, I personally harvest dead leaves. This year, I will try to harvest all I can. Use your vegetable waste, which supposes that you eat fresh food, not prepared meals… My family throws away 5 liters each day! And actually, it’s really difficult to get material sometimes unless you get very good at scrounging. So ask your neighbors. Put the words out around you! You might be surprised.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="about-temperature">About temperature&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Buy one of these thermometers &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3Up27gt">in France&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3UaOqlx">in the UK&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3DyAWZP">in the US&lt;/a> to measure the heat. You can make compost without heat, like leaf mold. Heat is just speeding up the process of decomposition. You should also watch the heat so it doesn’t go too much over 70 °C. Over that, you will use fungal activities. If you get over 70 °C, it usually happens as a &lt;em>flash&lt;/em> of heat after adding new green material.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-watering">What about watering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It doesn’t apply to what Charles has put on the heap in this vlog, which was mostly green. Also, too much moisture removes air from the materials and bacteria can’t live in it. You need water if it’s quite dry or if you have got a lot of brown. But in Charles’s case, where he lives, it’s quite wet all year long, so the quality of his compost has increased from the roof over his heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="maintaining-your-heap">Maintaining your heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, write when you start it. Also, when is it good to stop filling it? Well, as long as the levels keep lowering fast, you can keep filling it. You will notice very easily when it’s slowing. Next, you don’t need to turn often your compost, despite what you have heard. You always can, but it takes time to do so and isn’t it better to use this time to gather materials instead? Charles performs only one turning. &lt;strong>Go for it now!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They shot the vlog on the 8th of September 2019. So this is the 6th year of doing this comparison.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles says it’s a trial, but you could call it an experiment, but it’s not a scientific experiment as such.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>And the idea being to just see what difference that it makes to growth compared to no dig.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="striptwo">Strip Two&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The crops look bigger on strip Three, but pest damage offset the harvest yields.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, slugs attack the plants, but not always.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, Charles weights the harvest but discarding the outer leaves and anything that you wouldn’t eat or sell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And he observed that strip Three produced more waste over time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>He has been practicing no dig for 40 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="climates">Climates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Homeacres is wet while Wini leaves in a region that is a Mediterranean climate (very dry).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, No Dig provides them both what they need.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="winis-climate">Wini’s climate&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Chile, it’s essential to keep the water in the ground, to retain moisture and spend less water. Wini has found out that no dig really helps to achieve that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She has to water every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="charles-climate">Charle’s climate&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>On the contrary, Charles is trying to make sure the rain is draining. He receives 90 mm of rain every month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, because of No Dig, he needs not to worry about muddy bouts. The compost (for the garden) and woodchips (for the alleys) allow to have a clean soil.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Interesting fact&lt;/p>&lt;p>Charles has snow at one point and as the snow was melting, one bed retained the snow. It was a dig bed!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s saying that No Dig is keeping some warmth in the soil.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="who-inspired-charles">Who inspired Charles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before Homeacres, Charles started with a 6000 m² garden that he worked a tractor and rotavotor to chop weeds and the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Manually, he would then make beds for 3 months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But he told himself:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wait a minute, I don’t want to keep doing that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So he started researching and someone told him about a book from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Stout">Ruth Stout&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She taught about mulching with hay and Charles tried that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, slugs ate all the lettuces then… Why? Because in Charles’s climate, the hay hides the slugs that then eat the vegetables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles realized that he needed to modify her approach and he started using compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Very interestingly, Wini found her inspiration through Charles and in her research, she came back to Ruth Stout!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lessons-from-ruth-stout">Lessons from Ruth Stout&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>She rejected the conventional wisdom in regard to gardening and taught to try, see how it works and adjust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1948, on her first no dig bed, she was waiting for the plow to come. But it never came.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So she mulches with hay and it worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tree-and-garden">Tree and garden&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With their roots, trees are draining the water because the root breaks down the soil so it’s then less moist.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>As they said and I agree, it would depend on your situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My garden contains a lot of clay, so having small oaks, an almond tree and plants like comfrey or borage will loosen the soil, which is good for the vegetable I grow.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="visit-of-winis-garden">Visit of Wini’s garden&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What the garden produces is eaten and stored if it can’t be eaten right away. Wini does very little resale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She grows the usual vegetables, but also she tries out other things because of her curiosity and to help her children like what they eat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="original-garden-area-became-wild">Original garden area became wild&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the original garden area, she has the perennial plants and the volunteer plants (even carrots, potatoes). And she doesn’t work the soil, she only waters it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same area is also a place for flowers, bringing pollinators. It’s now untouched, going back its wild state.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-current-garden">The current garden&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Preparing the cultivated garden is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>covering with cardboard at the bottom of the beds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>setting up a wood frame for a raised bed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>applying compost and mulch&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>She can grow all year long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the fall, and because of her climate, they’re preparing for the Brassicaceae family (cabbages, kale, broccoli, etc.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She applies a new layer of compost and mulch on top of the previous one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the pathways, they have weeds that they mow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lessons-from-raised-beds">Lessons from raised beds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Deeper beds mean better water retention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a shallow bed (about 10 cm in depth), the compost dry very fast, even with heavy mulching.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mulching-technique">Mulching technique&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>She uses hay heavily. Without it, the first 4 to 5 cm of compost will dry out and will fly with the wind.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Living in Ardèche has a similar climate to Wini, so I do use a lot of dead leaves that I gather in the fall and cover the ground with a 20 cm deep layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s the blanket of the winter.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The downside of mulching is that bugs will live under it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pest-control">Pest control&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some bugs will eat your seedlings. Wini’s ingenious solution is to make stronger and more resilient seedlings that the bugs around her area won’t find attractive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Older plants work best for her.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="planting">Planting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>She does plan vegetables very close to each other, because it will help, from the foliage, to keep the moisture as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do have the same observation in my garden.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It will be a lot about teaching and learning, more than producing crops to resale on the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first year is the hardest year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digging this new area would require a lot of energy because of the abundance of clay.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Be happy with clay" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Be happy with clay&lt;/p>&lt;p>No Dig works &lt;strong>really&lt;/strong> well with clay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it retains moisture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it provides fertility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it doesn’t stick to boots anymore&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it builds a soil that has a good balance of drainage and moisture.&lt;/li>

&lt;h3 id="weeding-efficiently">Weeding efficiently&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You will need patience. But eventually, with No Dig, you can vanquish the toughest weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? In facts, covering the ground with cardboard and compost is already keeping the weeds at bay. But also, apply a plastic sheet on top for a month or two will deplete the weed roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, you might need to perform some follow-up work to root out the remaining weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="advantages-of-no-dig">Advantages of No Dig&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First, and let’s repeat it, compost doesn’t burn the roots. Hot compost is what burns the roots. It’s more about waiting for the&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, with a starting bed, you have 10 cm of compost, in which the plants will grow until they reach the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the soil has a lot of growing space, free from weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, while covered with the plastic sheet and waiting for the weeds to die, the soil life processed the compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s very quick to prepare.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="structure-of-the-soil">Structure of the soil&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It doesn’t need to be loose and fluffy. That’s what the rotavotor sellers want us to believe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soil needs to be firm but loose enough to help the roots of vegetables to go down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Firm is better than compact&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Identify problems, with Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/identify-problems-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/identify-problems-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-31-a-garden-bed-with-mostly-squashes.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Identify problems, with Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Gardening is full of conflicting advice.

&lt;p>It’s more a sequence of events where the plants are losing their older leaves.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Leaves can turn yellow all summer and it’s possible it isn’t a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the uchiki kuri squash won’t do well in a soil with a little bit of gravel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plants-know-how-much-they-produce">Plants know how much they produce&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It will happen, and I have indeed experienced this in the past, that you will see many fruits on a squash plant appearing, and some will grow to maturation and some will root in the early stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s fine and you shouldn’t worry much about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-squash-on-a-compost-heap-doesnt-deplete-the-nutrients">Growing squash on a compost heap doesn’t deplete the nutrients&lt;/h2>

&lt;h2 id="compost-doesnt-burn-the-roots">Compost doesn’t burn the roots&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It isn’t true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s true when the compost heap itself is still very hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hot compost means the early decomposition process is still going on and the plant won’t find enough goodness to grow well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The cause of charts bolting is the cold exposure if sown too early.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Growing vegetables can be all about compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how to make it and use it?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="it-doesnt-need-to-be-super-thin-and-perfect">It doesn’t need to be super thin and perfect&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Compost can contain pieces, even some wood, as long as it isn’t too big.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will provide the nourishment for fungal life.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You will see tiger or red worms, which are present in the final decomposition phase of the compost. It’s a good indicator that your compost nears readiness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You never see them before the temperature in low enough for them to settle in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="do-you-need-solid-sides-on-your-heap">Do you need solid sides on your heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Solid seem to work best, according to Charles’s experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-wood">What wood&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles uses Douglas wood planks, thick enough to hold the pretty big heaps.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="do-the-heaps-need-to-be-in-the-sun-or-shade">Do the heaps need to be in the sun or shade&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It doesn’t matter at all, as the heat comes from the breaking down of the material in the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn’t the sun that will make your compost hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The roof on Charles’s large heaps is to keep the rain off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? To make compost, you need air. If the compost is too soggy, no or little air is present in the heap and that will prevent the battery and the life in the compost to do their work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-often-should-i-turn-my-compost-heap">How often should I turn my compost heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Turning isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily done often. It will help giving the heap some air.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles turns it once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His heaps make it easy to transfer the content of a first heap into its neighbor.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles has a mobile divider between the heap so he can transfer the content easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="do-you-need-to-layer-the-content-of-the-heap">Do you need to layer the content of the heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Layering helps to make it easier to have a good balance of green and brown material (the 1/3 brown to 2/3 green ratio).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They will like the warmth of the heap, and Charles isn’t overrun by rats so he can’t give much advice about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe it’s because cats or wildlife like weasel eat the rats (&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BIV4lljN6Aw?t=503">see a filmed attack at Homeacres at 8:23&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Remember: you can put a lot of things in a heap, even some things that most people wouldn’t put in, like bindweed. I have been watching Charles’s vlogs for a while and tested myself the ideas he shares and I can tell you it is true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles explains that the bindweed loses the contact with the parent root in the heap. Within a month or two, the pulled-out roots loose the resources to develop and they die, even a cool heap.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="About weed seeds" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">About weed seeds&lt;/p>&lt;p>You must have heat to kill seeds, between 60 °C to 70 °C. Otherwise, they grow once you spread the compost in the beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But because they are on the top, it is easy to root them out again. But do it early!&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;li>Take off, or not depending on your preference, the bottoms&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attach the sides together with a wire on top and bottom (and even in the middle if necessary)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Put cardboard around the inside edges to keep the light out and the moisture as you will fill in the heap.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>weeds without the soil (because it will help the weed develop…)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Charles suggests to do the following to hold the structure in the heap:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>5 cm of green&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a thin layer of brown (autumn leaves, for example)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laBXwOdbOlw">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will look in this article how Charles suggests how to start no dig in your garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="starting-from-weeds">Starting from weeds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can use cardboard, then you apply a layer of compost, and you are done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have no weeds, it will not be necessary to use cardboard. But who doesn’t have weeds? ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, you can plant straight away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, it is OK to plan in compost&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-big-should-your-new-no-dig-beds-be">How big should your new no dig bed(s) be&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No matter the size, it will be the same area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But maybe start a smaller area.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparing-the-area">Preparing the area&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before you start with the bed, it is a good idea to cover the chosen area with black polythene cover (that you can reuse multiple times).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will serve to weaken the weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do it a month before the actual bed making.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The key is to keep the light away from the weeds. It will kill the plant’s roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, it is a method that doesn’t disturb the soil. The structure of the soil is important to keep, because we don&amp;rsquo;t see all that is going on in it. It is a very complex system.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shade is OK, and leafy crops will do OK compared to crops really needing the sun light (tomatoes for example).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have leaf-dense trees, maybe pruning them to produce less shade is better than cutting the tree down.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>With a tree, you will have roots and depending on the crops, it can affect the growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But most importantly, the fungal activity that a tree brings is positive for the soil quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So think well before cutting a tree down&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="soil-on-uneven-ground">Soil on uneven ground&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before applying the compost, you can cover the portions of the select area that are uneven with soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why soil rather than compost? It is because of the density of soil which will hold better on the long run. Meanwhile, the compost will shrink and the uneven ground will appear again.&lt;/p>

You can find weed roots like, bindweeds, dandelions, buttercup and more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bindweeds might not die in the soil, dandelions and creeping buttercup will.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So fish out the bindweed roots!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles’s homemade compost is rough and not the perfect compost, but it is quite woody and that helps to keep a good fungal activity, good for plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The composition is green waste, cardboard, mowing waste and woodchips.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Charles’s warning&lt;/p>&lt;p>The best way to use the compost made from woodchips is to put it on top.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Because large pieces of wood not yet decomposed can take the nitrogen out of the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, it is a fantastic mulch for pathways. Just put cardboard first. It will feed the soil and that is beneficial.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhHshAf2lpM">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="size-the-heap">Size the heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You need to size your heap according to your garden area and how much waste you will generate from the garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Charles’s case, it is big because he has a big area and in May, time of the vlog shooting, he has a lot of waste, whether it is from the garden or the mowing.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>above 50 °C&lt;/li>
&lt;li>around 60 °C to 70 °C to kill weed seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Also, a high temperature will also help producing compost quickly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the above picture, the worms you see were not there before. They are &lt;em>tiger worms&lt;/em> which eggs are the materials put in to make the compost and they are helping the composting process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Charles starts using compost after 7 months as the decomposition will continue on the soil.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>

&lt;p>For more woody or harder material, like the cauliflower stem below, you should cut it in smaller pieces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles shows below how to cut the stem in the length, which is much easier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Wildlife, like mice, toads, frogs, will be found in the heaps.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Apparently, the mushroom compost isn’t very successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? When the mushroom compost was very young, still hot and dry. Also, the compost is holding water much more than the rest, and the roots are probably being asphyxiated…&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pots1-to-3-homemade-compost-and-co">Pots 1 to 3: homemade compost and co&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Again, the homemade compost, pure or with a mix of worm compost, the results are not as Charles expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pots7-to-9-moorland-gold-compost">Pots 7 to 9: Moorland Gold compost&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is doing pretty well, and actually it does better with less worm compost, probably because the Moorland Gold compost is already pretty rich.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The spinach is the darkest one in pots 7 and 9.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="day30-updates">Day 30 updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The progress is producing very interesting results:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In pot 7 (100% Moorland Gold compost), the spinach is getting yellow, which mean the nutrients are running low.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In pot 9 (25% of worm compost and 75% Moorland Gold compost), the onions are much bigger&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Comparing pot 4 (100% woodchip compost) to pot 6 (50% of worm compost and 50% woodchip compost), the former isn’t looking as brilliant as on day 16, with a spinach looking yellow while the onion is OK. However, we clearly see the benefits of added worm compost in pot 6.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pot 1 (100% homemade compost) is showing another lesson: homemade compost has again won with the best-looking spinach in size even if it didn’t start out well (the onion is showing the sequels…).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Charles points out his homemade compost is not designed for potting, it doesn’t behave like the hare, but rather the tortoise :D&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Worm compost, in about 20–25% proportion, can boost your plants and give great results. Higher&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mushroom compost is showing that it would be good for potting, but let it age first. I wish I could say I can buy £50 per ton delivered for it! :O&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moorland Gold potting compost clearly shows it is not made to be used as it was in the trial. The plants must be transplanted in the ground.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A balance of good drainage and sufficient nutrients is the goal in the end and a slight variation will affect the root system and the health of the plant.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="do-we-need-to-add-anything-for-drainage-in-the-mix-to-grow-vegetables">Do we need to add anything for drainage in the mix to grow vegetables?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We are talking about vermiculite or feeds or amendments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles rarely uses vermiculite: only for lettuce and basil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are making seedlings, starting from a seed, it could make a difference. But at the stage of growth of the picture below, it won’t.&lt;/p>

How much do you spread? The guidelines explained by Charles in a No Dig approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s71f18ila1c">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will look into the misunderstandings and questions about compost and spreading it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-best-time-to-spread-compost">What is the best time to spread compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This question leads to the misunderstanding that nutrients leach out of compost. They don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost isn&amp;rsquo;t fertilizer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost feeds soil life and helps build the mycelia threads beneficial for the soil and plants, like you can see below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They make available the nutrients which sits there insoluble in water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can spread the compost in autumn to please the soil the most. And you can apply the compost around existing crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-much-compost">How much compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles put every year 2.5 cm, but it&amp;rsquo;s close to 2 cm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Putting the compost in the winter benefits the growth of two different crops a year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You will need 4 cubic meters, which equals to 2.4 tons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles details that you don’t spread compost the whole area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the pathways can be covered with woodchips or tiles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;h2 id="what-does-well-rotted-compost-mean">What does well-rotted compost mean&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, a compost doesn’t need to be perfect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wood pieces are for fungal life.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-kind-of-compost">What kind of compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will have:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Homemade, of about 1 year old, depending on how much woody parts you have in it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Green waste, that you need to age to yield a good result.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Manure represents food for the soil, but again, try not to use it fresh or use it in a thin layer. It&amp;rsquo;s not technically compost as a fresh product, but becomes one after a year of maturation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Woodchips can become compost, but it will require a lot of time so the wood decomposes well. &lt;em>Remember&lt;/em>, the woodchip below will look like wood after the rain washes it.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Three-month-old compost, still steaming, isn&amp;rsquo;t ready to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will know when the temperature isn&amp;rsquo;t high anymore. It will give you better results when using a mature compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Indeed, the living organisms in the soil won’t have to perform the heavy work of breaking down the material in the compost and will focus on bringing the nutrients to the plants.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will review the vlogs from Charles about the trays later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you can wait, watch them now:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmWsM7odmkE">My new 60 cells and long life module tray&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK-Gkp_LTPc">New Charles Dowding module trays of 15 and 30 cells&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-grown-in-the-trial">What is grown in the trial&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles is doing the trial using radish and lettuce (batavia type).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="filling-the-trays">Filling the trays&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Don’t be afraid to fill them pretty full, e.g., pressing the compost into the modules so it is dense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Because the modules are small.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="watering">Watering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The initial watering needs to make the trays fully moist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But after that, you don’t need to water daily. A rule would be to water enough so the compost stays humid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The seedlings will require more watering later, as the seedlings grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-will-the-seedlings-be-ready-for-transplanting">When will the seedlings be ready for transplanting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Radish will be ready first, about 2–3 weeks after sowing them in the trays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lettuce will need another week.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="week1-updates">Week 1 updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles received some worm compost so he prepared 2 trays:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>one with this worm compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one with the Yorkshire compost to be able to make a proper comparison.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As for the other trays, the progress is already quite significant:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Homemade compost&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>All compost did pretty well, overall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can see some differences, with some lettuces lost (not due to compost but more from the seedling used).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, remember that the soil of Charles’s garden is quite rich and fertile. I wonder how in proportion he uses his homemade compost versus the Moorland Gold he buys.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Yes. Even the ones with seeds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To kill the seeds, you will have to heat above 50-55°C to prevent the seeds to germinate.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-heat-a-compost">How do you heat a compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You follow the proper ratio of fresh green and carbon materials with enough water (but not too much) until the compost is ready.&lt;/p>

Start today!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding&amp;rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2scvQgm6HFw">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="when-to-use-one">When to use one&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In small gardens, there may not be space for the 3 bins made of pallets. So, it can be that the plastic model (of about 300 L depending on the model) is your pick.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-get-the-compost-out">How to get the compost out&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Not from the top obviously, since this is where you put your fresh material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The one showcased in the vlog has a bottom opening, but it is not always very practical to get compost out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bin shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have a bottom, so simply pull up the bin to see the composting progress.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But how do you know potatoes are close to the point of harvest?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The leaves are turning yellow&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The stems are dropping down&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>There is no one perfect timing, but the 2 tips above gives you an idea.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Amazingly, Charles doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to water as of July. But he would need to water if the dry weather continues a few more weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, the climate in Summerset is probably much more humid than the South of France where I live, but that&amp;rsquo;ll need to be tested, because Damien Dekarz said the same thing while cultivating more South of my location the Tarn area.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Why are onions not watered? Charles waits at the point where it is close to harvest to water them, then getting a nice swell-up of the bulbs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When the stems looks like the picture above, it is a sign the onions are ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bending of the neck is to help the onions to start drying. It will help for storage later on. You can just pull the onions off the soil and let them dry for a few days.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can see how the stems of the cucumber plants are well trimmed from the ground to about 2 feet up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cucumbers we see above have been sowed on April 15th.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, to get the plant size you see, it needs a lot of water.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-and-seedlings-in-the-greenhouse">Growing and seedlings in the greenhouse&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It seems that the tomatoes do better in terms of leaf quality in the greenhouse because of the smaller temperature difference between night and day than in a polytunnel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But it does get hot (Charles had up to 38°C&amp;hellip;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cucumbers like the warmth, but one needs to be careful with the seedlings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In regards to melons, if you grow different varieties close to each other, keeping the seeds of the fruits may not produce the same plant the next because hybridization.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles suggests watching &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/joegardenerTV?app=desktop">Joe Lampl&amp;rsquo;s channel&lt;/a> to know more about tomatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Picking your tomatoes not fully rip take some stress off the plant, which can focus the other fruits, new fruits and the leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And you don&amp;rsquo;t lose flavor from the tomatoes by harvesting them this way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How much and how little compost do you need to grow great vegetables, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/how-much-compost-to-grow-great-vegetables-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/how-much-compost-to-grow-great-vegetables-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-13-how-much--how-little-compost-do-you-need-to-grow-great-vegetables-charles-dowding-hero.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How much and how little compost do you need to grow great vegetables, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Compost is a key element to grow great vegetables. But how much or how little is a question that Charles Dowding will answer for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article represents my notes from his vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding&amp;rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4APqcvo-gqE">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With no dig, you need less compost (this is from 10 years of experience).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But the sure thing is that you will need descent compost. And if you use a good compost, you will need very little, especially with No Dig.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="clarification-of-the-meaning-of-compost">Clarification of the meaning of compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When we talk about compost, we talk about organic material, not fertilizers and synthetic feeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost is anything decomposed. It does not need to be perfect, e.g., it can have some piece of wood.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At first, you may need to buy some compost. But after a while, if you look after your soil, you won&amp;rsquo;t need as much and you can find materials to make your own from local waste.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>Strip 1&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It was the strip where the soil was dug and he used no compost.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Strip 2&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It was the strip where the soil was not dug and no compost was used.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Strip 3&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It was the strip where the soil was not dug &lt;strong>AND&lt;/strong> some compost was used (5-6 cm of well-rotted compost).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>On all strips were planted the same crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the 2013 harvest, the yields were as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;h2 id="modification-of-trial-and-results-in-2014">Modification of trial and results in 2014&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This time, Charles and his team applied the following trial:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Strip 1: forked with 2-3 cm of compost each year.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The soil is loosened, before applying compost .&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Strip 2: no dig with 2-3 cm of compost each year.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Strip 3: no dig with 2-3 cm of well-rotted cow manure each year.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For strips 1 and 2, the compost is green waste compost purchased combined with homemade compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And here are the yield results in 2014 compared to 2013:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Strip&lt;/th>
&lt;th>2013&lt;/th>
&lt;th>2014&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>1&lt;/td>
&lt;td>41.2 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;td>68.0 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2&lt;/td>
&lt;td>40.6 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;td>79.0 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>3&lt;/td>
&lt;td>61.5 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;td>75.0 kg&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h2 id="progress-of-2015">Progress of 2015&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>By that year, the yields went up to 100 kg per strip!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each year, the amount of compost applied is about 3 to 5 cm, spread in February.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="How to cover the pathways" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">How to cover the pathways&lt;/p>&lt;p>Use well rotted woodchips.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Digging or not digging, compost is a must. Period.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The big differences between each bed are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>That the no dig bed requires a lot of less work not digging since you just need to cover the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The dig bed is more difficult to water (water flows more).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The dig bed has a lot more leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In 9 years,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The dig bed yielded 855 kg of produce.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The no-dig bed yielded 953 kg of produce, &lt;strong>just about 10%&lt;/strong> more.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Again, here, we can take home that the use of compost makes a big difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And it is applied once a year in the change of years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is more information about &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba0qPjF_wNI">dig vs no dig methods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Also, hardneck garlic is better suited for cold climates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, hardneck garlic produced some beautiful scapes (the top of the stem that will flower and that you need to cut off and eat!)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="softneck-garlic">Softneck garlic&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Even if they produce smaller bulbs, there are more cloves in one head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you live in a warmer climate, softneck garlic is a good choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="planting">Planting&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="when">When&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It starts from mid-October and mid-December.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any earlier and you may lose your plants over a really cold winter if they have developed too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal thought" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal thought&lt;/p>&lt;p>That probably means that planting from mid-September (like &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/grow-garlic-easy-with-no-dig-tips-for-harvest-charles-dowding/">Charles Dowding suggested&lt;/a>) may be only possible under a polytunnel or greenhouse.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Any later, you risk your bulbs to be underdeveloped.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="spacing">Spacing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can plant each clove quite close to each other, between 7 cm to 10 cm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, to increase the amount of garlic planted, you can use the diagonal method:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Also, plant your garlic in various areas (3-4 locations, if possible) rather than just one place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing">Growing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most important thing is the plant focuses its energy on the bulb, not the flowering stem (see &lt;a href="#hardneck-garlic">above&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, mostly, you can forget about garlic for almost 8 months.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If there is a period in spring and early summer with no rain, give garlic a heavy soaking.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="harvest">Harvest&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It happens when the bottom 50% of leaves have turned brown (or end of June).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also enjoy garlic from late April into may. This is called &lt;em>green garlic&lt;/em> where you can eat not only the bulb but also the stem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Garlic doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be dried to eat it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="drying-and-storing">Drying and storing&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Let garlic dry for a full day under the sun&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then move it to dry in the airy place, hanging or lying down on a table, for 4 to 6 weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After the drying, cut off the stem, leaving 5 cm like shown below

&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="other-tips">Other tips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To grow more food from the same patch of land, planting beans following harvest is a good idea&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To store garlic, you can also ferment it with salt and water. Huw Richards talked about a recipe with honey and garlic that can be kept for a year. I&amp;rsquo;ll look into this.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal experience" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal experience&lt;/p>&lt;p>I tried it with carrots and it tastes really good, and amazingly, the spicy side of garlic is done after 1 month of fermentation.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="diseases">Diseases&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="white-rot">White rot&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=white%20rot%20disease">White rot&lt;/a> affects the Allium family, which the garlic is belonging to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you do get this, to avoid it, just don&amp;rsquo;t grow garlic in that same place for 3 to 4 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rust">Rust&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This disease is far less of a problem.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply, remove the worst affected leaves. Then when it comes to harvest, remove the outer layer and the garlic will be fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As long as you take care of the soil, rust goes away. You can also apply lactic acid bacteria using a spray.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Plant Garlic From Start to Finish, by The Dutch Farmer</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-plant-garlic-start-to-finish-the-dutch-farmer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-plant-garlic-start-to-finish-the-dutch-farmer/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-09-29-a-garlic-and-some-cloves.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to Plant Garlic From Start to Finish, by The Dutch Farmer" />&lt;p>Step by step, Moreno shows how to plant this crop successfully.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Garlic is not too difficult to grow and it stores well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growing outdoors can bring rust much more than under a polytunnel and greenhouse. Also, it will grow bigger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is no real solution to rust.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Softneck garlic is harvested about 2-3 weeks earlier than hardneck garlic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A feature that you may like from the hardneck garlic is the cloves tend to be bigger and therefore easier to peel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-plant">How to plant&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You need to space each plant by 10 cm and row by 30 cm apart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Planting will happen in October on average, but it can happen from mid-September to the end of December. However, the earlier, the better the crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steps to plant are quite easy:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Take the best bulbs from the year before, &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/supermarket-garlic-for-seed-charles-dowding/">try to start from one organic bulb in your local supermarket&lt;/a>, preferably organic.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use a wood stick to make a 2-3 cm hole.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sow each clove the same way they were growing in the bulb.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cover over and you are done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="when-to-harvest">When to harvest&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the UK, the harvest time around the end of June.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my area, in Ardèche, it seems to be the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When to harvest garlic has nothing to do with how yellow the leaves are. At least half the leaves should still be green &lt;strong>unless a severe case of rust has attacked the plants&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What you want to feel around the bulb are the protrusions (e.g., where the cloves are forming). This is when the garlic is mature. You can feel this by uncovering the top of the garlic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you leave the garlic too long, you will get the following:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="how-to-harvest">How to harvest&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Take the garlic out by pulling it gently while digging it out gently to keep the stem and / or the remaining leaves. Keeping the stem will help conserving it longer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cut the roots while fresh.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Peel out the first outer skin because it is a lot easier&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-store-garlic">How to store garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At first, right after harvest, you can leave quite a bite of stem to help the garlic finish ripening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t leave garlic under the direct sun too long. Two days is enough to dry the outer skin, otherwise, it can start deteriorating. Then, put it under cover to dry some more for about 20 days, with enough air.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to judge the readiness of garlic, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-judge-the-readiness-of-garlic-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-judge-the-readiness-of-garlic-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-09-22-how-to-judge-the-readiness-of-garlic-charles-dowding-hero.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to judge the readiness of garlic, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Credits: &lt;a href="https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/fr/view-image.php?image=206292&amp;amp;picture=germination-ail">George Hodan on publicdomainpictures.net&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is a rampant fungal disease that infects the entire Allium family, including garlic and onions. If left unchecked, the disease can result in smaller-than-usual bulbs and limited growth of a plant. Garlic infected by rust is still edible and unless the infection was severe, you should get a decently sized bulb at harvest time. There’s no need to prematurely pick your garlic crop unless the entire plant is brown and dead. (Like “dead dead”, not “ready and ripe” dead.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We could set the compost material it right on the ground but:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t decompose as fast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get hot as it should&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it will take more space.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So using a compost bin is a good choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-kind-of-bin-and-size">What kind of bin and size?&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Those that are square-shaped from the stores can hold up to 0.6 meter cube works better on the bare ground but it seems not to be enough to get efficient and hot enough (apparently max of 55°c).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can get a good compost below those temperatures but the weed seeds will be able to sprout again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To kill weed seeds, you need to get to 55°c or above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is, however, not very strong and plastic is a great conductor of heat so the temperatures can&amp;rsquo;t get very high.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You just knock out the &amp;ldquo;feet&amp;rdquo; of the pallets. It allows you to save some space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To assemble them easily, use a metal wire at the top and bottom. No screws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a good idea to put cardboard under the bottom of each heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The model of pallet is not necessarily the EURPAL ones but the planks need to be close to each (about 5 cm max). This will help to keep the air flow to a minimum to keep the moisture and also help to keep everything inside the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is fine to put weeds (maybe not brambles ;-))&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using cardboard to cover the sides from inside.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So with three bins, for example&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You fill the left one first&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then you start to fill the right one once the left is full.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the left has shrunk half the size, you empty it into the middle one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the right bin is full, you start to fill out the left again.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the right has shrunk half the size, you empty it into the middle one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When the middle one is 5-6 months old or if the compost is ready, you can empty it and use the compost so that you can start to fill it again from the side bins.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>It will cost more because of the amount of wood. But with a large size (1.5 meter cube), the heat goes much higher and therefore, the compost can be ready faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes 5 weeks to fill it with a 4000 m².&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within three months, however, the compost can be ready to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles uses a five-bin structure that obviously requires a lot of wood to build the structure&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ACTION:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Design a two-bin structure to quote it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Find wood to recycle maybe&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In winter, keep the compost out of the rain so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t get too wet.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To kill weed seeds, you need to get to 55°c or above.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Keep the temperatures between 55°c and 70°c but not above to keep the fungal properties of the future compost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To lower the temperatures, add brown material.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A compost should be moist but not too wet to be too smelly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The following are my notes from the vlog &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7Aa525oW34">&amp;ldquo;Three Types of Heap, see how they work and the compost they make&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a> from Charles Dowding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We could set the compost material it right on the ground but:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t decompose as fast&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get hot as it should&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it will take more space.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So using a compost bin is a good choice.&lt;/p>
