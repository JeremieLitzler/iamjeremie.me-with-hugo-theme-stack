&lt;p>Take the time for your spouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take the time for your children.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take the time for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Balance all that and be satisfied that what you get is what you get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about what you can do with a very focused mind, not going left or right when you are pulled in those directions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, look in front of you and work towards that goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes you see it, it is always in sight. So you can reach it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, don’t forget: the journey is more rewarding than the goal to reach.
It’s during the journey that you learn to reach your goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may just find that the goal is as important as what you learned to get to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having balanced lifestyle will help because extremes are toxic. They are the reason you go right or left, loosing focus on the Goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It must be adjusted often, like adding weight the wavering scale of life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Be the master of it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
