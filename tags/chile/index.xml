&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTXrx-gaadA">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles runs a market garden on 1000 m² that supplies the local town.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time of the vlog, he’s talking about expanding the area cultivated.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>He has been practicing no dig for 40 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="climates">Climates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Homeacres is wet while Wini leaves in a region that is a Mediterranean climate (very dry).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, No Dig provides them both what they need.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="winis-climate">Wini’s climate&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Chile, it’s essential to keep the water in the ground, to retain moisture and spend less water. Wini has found out that no dig really helps to achieve that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She has to water every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="charles-climate">Charle’s climate&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>On the contrary, Charles is trying to make sure the rain is draining. He receives 90 mm of rain every month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yet, because of No Dig, he needs not to worry about muddy bouts. The compost (for the garden) and woodchips (for the alleys) allow to have a clean soil.&lt;/p>

&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Interesting fact" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Interesting fact&lt;/p>&lt;p>Charles has snow at one point and as the snow was melting, one bed retained the snow. It was a dig bed!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s saying that No Dig is keeping some warmth in the soil.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="who-inspired-charles">Who inspired Charles&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Before Homeacres, Charles started with a 6000 m² garden that he worked a tractor and rotavotor to chop weeds and the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Manually, he would then make beds for 3 months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But he told himself:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Wait a minute, I don’t want to keep doing that.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>So he started researching and someone told him about a book from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Stout">Ruth Stout&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She taught about mulching with hay and Charles tried that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, slugs ate all the lettuces then… Why? Because in Charles’s climate, the hay hides the slugs that then eat the vegetables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles realized that he needed to modify her approach and he started using compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Very interestingly, Wini found her inspiration through Charles and in her research, she came back to Ruth Stout!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lessons-from-ruth-stout">Lessons from Ruth Stout&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>She rejected the conventional wisdom in regard to gardening and taught to try, see how it works and adjust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 1948, on her first no dig bed, she was waiting for the plow to come. But it never came.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So she mulches with hay and it worked.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tree-and-garden">Tree and garden&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With their roots, trees are draining the water because the root breaks down the soil so it’s then less moist.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>As they said and I agree, it would depend on your situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My garden contains a lot of clay, so having small oaks, an almond tree and plants like comfrey or borage will loosen the soil, which is good for the vegetable I grow.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="visit-of-winis-garden">Visit of Wini’s garden&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What the garden produces is eaten and stored if it can’t be eaten right away. Wini does very little resale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She grows the usual vegetables, but also she tries out other things because of her curiosity and to help her children like what they eat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="original-garden-area-became-wild">Original garden area became wild&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the original garden area, she has the perennial plants and the volunteer plants (even carrots, potatoes). And she doesn’t work the soil, she only waters it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same area is also a place for flowers, bringing pollinators. It’s now untouched, going back its wild state.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-current-garden">The current garden&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Preparing the cultivated garden is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>covering with cardboard at the bottom of the beds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>setting up a wood frame for a raised bed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>applying compost and mulch&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>She can grow all year long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the fall, and because of her climate, they’re preparing for the Brassicaceae family (cabbages, kale, broccoli, etc.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She applies a new layer of compost and mulch on top of the previous one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the pathways, they have weeds that they mow.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="lessons-from-raised-beds">Lessons from raised beds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Deeper beds mean better water retention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a shallow bed (about 10 cm in depth), the compost dry very fast, even with heavy mulching.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mulching-technique">Mulching technique&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>She uses hay heavily. Without it, the first 4 to 5 cm of compost will dry out and will fly with the wind.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Living in Ardèche has a similar climate to Wini, so I do use a lot of dead leaves that I gather in the fall and cover the ground with a 20 cm deep layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s the blanket of the winter.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The downside of mulching is that bugs will live under it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pest-control">Pest control&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some bugs will eat your seedlings. Wini’s ingenious solution is to make stronger and more resilient seedlings that the bugs around her area won’t find attractive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Older plants work best for her.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="planting">Planting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>She does plan vegetables very close to each other, because it will help, from the foliage, to keep the moisture as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I do have the same observation in my garden.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It will be a lot about teaching and learning, more than producing crops to resale on the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first year is the hardest year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digging this new area would require a lot of energy because of the abundance of clay.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Be happy with clay" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Be happy with clay&lt;/p>&lt;p>No Dig works &lt;strong>really&lt;/strong> well with clay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it retains moisture&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it provides fertility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it doesn’t stick to boots anymore&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it builds a soil that has a good balance of drainage and moisture.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="weeding-efficiently">Weeding efficiently&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You will need patience. But eventually, with No Dig, you can vanquish the toughest weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? In facts, covering the ground with cardboard and compost is already keeping the weeds at bay. But also, apply a plastic sheet on top for a month or two will deplete the weed roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, you might need to perform some follow-up work to root out the remaining weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="advantages-of-no-dig">Advantages of No Dig&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>First, and let’s repeat it, compost doesn’t burn the roots. Hot compost is what burns the roots. It’s more about waiting for the&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, with a starting bed, you have 10 cm of compost, in which the plants will grow until they reach the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the soil has a lot of growing space, free from weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, while covered with the plastic sheet and waiting for the weeds to die, the soil life processed the compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, it&amp;rsquo;s very quick to prepare.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="structure-of-the-soil">Structure of the soil&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It doesn’t need to be loose and fluffy. That’s what the rotavotor sellers want us to believe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soil needs to be firm but loose enough to help the roots of vegetables to go down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Firm is better than compact&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
