Using nettle, we can increase and reach success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-is-fpj">What is FPJ&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>FPJ stands for Fermented Plant Juice, obtained with brown sugar or vinegar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You use the liquid from that. When we use plants, we want to extract the minerals from those plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="how-do-you-make-fpj">How do you make FPJ&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The process is simple to produce FPJ:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you sizzle the target plant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you add organic brown sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you mix up and wait&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sugar will work as a solvent, extracting all the good stuff from the plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s even more important when you deal with a broad spectrum plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A broad spectrum plant is a plant that contains the 14–16 minerals plants need to grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stinging nettle has all of them and the fermentation extraction provide the exact proportion the plants need!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-the-water-method-and-the-sugar-method">What is the difference between the water method and the sugar method&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The rain water method works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main differences are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the concentration level of minerals that is higher with the brown sugar method.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>consequently, the dilution will be more important: 500 to 1 instead of 10 to 1.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the shelf life is very good and the smell absent.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To compare to making compost, it takes up to 2 years to obtain compost and even more time so that the soil assimilates the nutrients from it to give as food to the plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another advantage: you can apply the fermented juice directly and the plant assimilates within the minerals from it within hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, the making of FPJ takes very little time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Apart from the broad spectrum, the nettle will provide the boost of nutrients that the seeds need to get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like a baby needs very close care and attention in the first 2 years of his life, the seedling needs the same care and attention to become a productive and healthy crop.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>a 2-liter stainless bowl&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a couple of jars:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>one of 250 ml that will hold the juice,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one of 1 liter to make the juice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>a cotton clothe&lt;/li>

&lt;li>a scale&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a pair of scissors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a pan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a fennel&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a pair of gloves, because nettles sting!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a sterilized rock that fits in the jar : it will hold the plant&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Optionally, read the book &lt;em>The regenerative grower’s guide to Garder Amendments&lt;/em> by Nigel Palmer (available &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/43yjh0C">in France&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3mpFKMy">in the UK&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/43k8PcS">in the US&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

But do you know a lot of weeds that are 10 times more useful than dreadful?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkUmwlJ5RQ8">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw details 7 reasons to grow more nettle in your vegetable garden is a great idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reason1-it-attracts-aphids">Reason #1: It attracts aphids&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The nettle is great to house all the aphids that are around the crops you are growing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So grow them close to the vegetables that aphids love.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>But I don’t like that!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I harvest nettle to eat and I don’t want to eat them…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have found that soaking the nettle in water with vinegar helps to detach all the aphids off the nettle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use a salad spinner to finish off the aphids that might hang on tight :)&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;p>Why? To help feed the wildlife. Whom am I thinking about? Ladybugs, of course!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ladybugs love aphids and aphids love nettle so ladybugs love nettles :)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Also, many butterflies love nettles as it’s their main source of food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So grow a patch of nettle right away. Go find a patch into the wild and pull a few roots or a female nettle that has gone to seed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The male and female flowers occur on separate plants. Both flower sexes are green with yellow stamens, but the male flowers often have a purplish tinge and the female flowers tend to droop much more than the male flowers point upward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is an example of female nettle:&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dig a shallow trench and set the roots just like that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Within a few months, nettles will come out. Within a year, they will spread :)&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="reason3-its-a-superfood">Reason #3: It’s a superfood&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It contains:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a lot of vitamins (A, C, K, severable B type)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of minerals, like calcium, iron&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of proteins: in 100 grams of dried nettle, you find up to 30 grams of proteins.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

It just hurt.&lt;/p>&lt;p>Or check out the young Huw showcasing how to do it with bear hands in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy9yyMjtWWQ">&amp;ldquo;How to Eat Nettles without getting Stung&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Cooking the nettle get rid of their sting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, simply washing the nettle with cold water or drying them won’t.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When you pick nettle, pick the first 3 levels of leaves, which are tender and less fibrous, especially regarding the stem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most nutritious part is the seeds. They contain vitamin E and essential fatty acids.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A teaspoon per day will help quite a lot of your health.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reason4-its-a-bioindicator">Reason #4: It’s a bioindicator&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What a bioindicator? It’s what the presence of a wild plant in a certain area tells us about the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So nettle indicates that the soil is rich and moist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So wherever you see neetle, you’re very likely to be successful with your gardening.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reason5-it-serves-as-a-good-green-mulching">Reason #5: It serves as a good green mulching&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Nettle is loaded with nitrogen and potassium. So cutting nettle in bulk, you can then take it and spread it over a bed to boost the soil with the nutrients it contains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apply it as a green mulch around the perennials’ base.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steps are simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cut in pieces the nettles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add them into a bucket (half full after pressing on them)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add water to the top of the nettle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>set a log or a stone over it to make sure the nettles are under water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>leave for 2 weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>use the liquid feed with a ratios 1 to 10: one part liquid feed and nine parts water.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Because nettle contains a high quantity of manganese and calcium, you can use them for plants lacking those nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reason7-its-a-great-compost-ingredient">Reason #7: It’s a great compost ingredient&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Of course, use young nettle if you don’t want them to grow in the compost. Or do you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nettle brings huge improvement to the garden. When you search &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nettle&amp;#43;garden">&lt;em>nettle+garden&lt;/em> on Google&lt;/a>, you find 12M results!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reason8-it-makes-a-great-herbal-infusion">Reason #8: It makes a great herbal infusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To do so, cut some fresh nettle, wash them and pour boiling water over it.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I always eat the boiled nettles after 15 min. That way, you waste nothing :)&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
