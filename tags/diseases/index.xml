So who should you believe. You might see a problem in a garden, is it really? Let’s dive into it with Charles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Charles shares that in his experience, it isn’t the end of the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s more a sequence of events where the plants are losing their older leaves.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Leaves can turn yellow all summer and it’s possible it isn’t a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, the uchiki kuri squash won’t do well in a soil with a little bit of gravel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plants-know-how-much-they-produce">Plants know how much they produce&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It will happen, and I have indeed experienced this in the past, that you will see many fruits on a squash plant appearing, and some will grow to maturation and some will root in the early stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That’s fine and you shouldn’t worry much about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-squash-on-a-compost-heap-doesnt-deplete-the-nutrients">Growing squash on a compost heap doesn’t deplete the nutrients&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Remember: compost is about biological activation of what is already in the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="compost-doesnt-burn-the-roots">Compost doesn’t burn the roots&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It isn’t true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s true when the compost heap itself is still very hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A hot compost means the early decomposition process is still going on and the plant won’t find enough goodness to grow well.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="root-vegetables-lessons">Root vegetables lessons&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It has been said so often that big root vegetables go woody.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s absolutely not true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe, if it tastes woody, it’s more to do with a poor soil?&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Interesting fact&lt;/p>&lt;p>When you cut open a fresh beetroot, you should see some &lt;em>rings&lt;/em>, one for every moon cycle.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Sowing Swiss chard shouldn’t happen too early to avoid bolting. Charles suggests for his location to sow charts in April.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cause of charts bolting is the cold exposure if sown too early.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, regarding seedlings, don’t hold them for too long because their quality will decrease.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-yellow-leaves-tell-us">What yellow leaves tell us&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s indicating a low nitrogen level.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sometimes, a plant won’t grow for some reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Blaming yourself is then counterproductive. Observe instead and find out why the plant didn’t grow.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
