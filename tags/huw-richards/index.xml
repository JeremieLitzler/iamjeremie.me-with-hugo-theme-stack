And yet, gaps may start to appear. Let’s see what Huw suggests to fill them out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

&lt;h2 id="default-setting-spread-compost">Default “setting”: spread compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw suggests that the default “setting” is to cover the empty area with compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because a healthy soil is key to success in the garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A healthy soil consists of minerals, organic matter and also all of the microbes such as bacteria and fungi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And one way to promote a healthy soil is by using methods such as the No Dig method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been using this method for 3 years now. At first, I was experimenting to find the materials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, with the No Dig method, you want to apply light layers of mulch of compost of around two to three centimeters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But how do you find that compost?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you were a commercial gardener like Charles Dowding, you could make you own. But most of us aren’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So this year, I’ve found how to find a large amount of compost: in France, it seems that places, where you can buy sand, gravels and other stony products, you can also buy organic compost in bulk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me, it’s a place nearby (10 min drive) and the ton of compost costs 48 euros.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The weight-to-volume ratio is 1 kilogram = 2 liters. So for 1000 liters or 1 meter cube, I need to buy 500 kg.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost can be used as a protective layer for the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have a choice then. Either:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you plant some crops that will be ready late fall, e.g., radish, lettuce, turnips and spinach, at least in zone 8 climate. For more details, you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkCvNpvL6XI">watch this vlog from Liz Zorab&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you let the land rest by applying some cardboard weighted down.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the latter case, it will be ready in the spring and it will be free of weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="try-out-things">Try out things&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw says:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>One of the most enjoyable parts of growing food is when you push against the norm and against common wisdom and try something different, and when you get pleasantly surprised that something new, that isn’t really recommended, actually turns out well for you, then that’s a huge sense of joy and excitement.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To me, this is the fact that I tried kiwaï vine, that produces small fruits rich in vitamin C.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s found in my garden for 3 years now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We planted a second vine this winter because the first one is so productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a false start on the first year (we had severe frost in April 2021), last year saw a successful harvest of a bit of fruits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year, it will be even better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I haven’t heard about kiwaï before I tasted it in a local farmer market near our home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I found it in the gardening store and purchased it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s easy to plant and rather small at the beginning. Yet, it will grow taller than you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It likes to climb a regular fence meshes with 10 cm squares.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another test I did, which is now not a test but a regular thing we do in our garden, is the No Dig method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why did I pick it up? Because I can spend energy digging in the garden. I can’t buy the petrol-powered tools to till the soil either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So No Dig made perfect sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, Huw gives the example of planting broad beans in August just to try and see what happens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, did you know you can eat the top of the plant as shoots? I didn’t!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgkePmjrX10">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="succession-planting">Succession planting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This method is important to optimize the garden space and always have something growing in all available areas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, Huw followed potatoes with leaks in this month of July.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Bouncing of leaks" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Bouncing of leaks&lt;/p>&lt;p>If a leak looks a little bit sad after transplantation, it’s OK. Water them and they will recover shortly.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="harvesting-lettuces">Harvesting lettuces&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Similarly to Charles Dowding, Huw adopted the method to harvest lettuces by picking the outer leaves regularly, which helps to produce a lot more than cutting the salad.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-parsley-under-runner-beans">Growing parsley under runner beans&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Parsley likes shade. What better idea than growing it under runner beans, that climb up high. At least, for Huw, it has been very successful.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="squashes">Squashes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I agree with Huw about squashes: don’t plan them too packed because all varieties grow and spread a lot. I see that with my volunteer curry pumpkins, that I have been grown from the seeds. I throw in the compost pile the seeds after prepare a dish and, in the past four years, they have work awesomely well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They always produce so much, in my opinion, especially when you know that I only water them during the summer and they produce from 12 to 17 kg of crops per year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, I never get diseases with those volunteer squashes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="no-dig-focus">No Dig focus&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw’s garden was already 95% No Dig in 2021, at the time of the shooting of the vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using &lt;a href="../../../tag/charles-dowding">Charles Dowding&lt;/a> No Dig, he will use organic matter to built up some strong and resilient soil life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve been trying out the No Dig also for 3 years. The main challenge is to gather enough organic matter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My most successful organic matter is cottonwood dead leaves. They’re small and abundant around my area and last winter, the girls and I picked up 12 trailers (700 liters of volume) and we have got a good amount left still. Worms have found their home in the leftover piles, which is awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use them to cover the bed in winter (about 20 to 30 cm thick layer) and I add some to cover the irrigation pipes in the summer to protect them from the sun.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="plug-in-gaps-technique">Plug in gaps technique&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With a no garden plan, you prepare seedlings and fill the gaps in beds, finding a home for everyone.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Flowers attract pollinators in the garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, as a message to my future self, grow more. The ladies in the household will appreciate it :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the moment, we have got comfrey, borages, Echinacea, one cosmos flower, self-sown from last year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Just like Huw, I love sweet peas. They taste just awesome, right off the plant, no need to cook them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This year, we harvested seeds from pods we let grow big and hopefully, we’ll plant them next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s amazing to harvest your own seed, making your garden resilient as you enter the cycle of self-sufficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’d love to find those pink and purple sweet peas that Huw grows. Mine are only white.&lt;/p>

Let’s look at what Huw is recommending to do this month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z18czx2fdzc">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tomatoes">Tomatoes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, clean up the weeds at the bottom of the bottom of the plants&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, remove the &lt;em>suckers&lt;/em>, which are those stems coming out which will make your plant huge, but that will draw energy out of producing tomatoes. It’s especially true in cooler climates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cutting everything (suckers and leaves) below the first &lt;em>trust&lt;/em> or the first flowers will go a long way to keep the plant healthy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, clearing the base will increase airflow to prevent blite.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, clear out the older leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See how Huw does it from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/z18czx2fdzc?t=148">2:28 in the vlog&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rain-and-watering">Rain and watering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Gathering rain water, even in the UK for Huw, has become an issue. The vlog dates back to 2020! So imagine today…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With dry weather, keeping up with watering is hard…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plus, some vegetables will tend to bolt, meaning they will go to seed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With less water, you can also clean up the dead leaves to make sure diseases don’t spread and so that the garden looks tidy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="more-sowing">More sowing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can still see at this time of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-can-you-sow">What can you sow?&lt;/h3>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>It will depend on your climate, your region. Even if you can find templates here and there, the real method is to use the guidelines of people around your area with experience and ask them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, because everyone has a unique garden, it’s through observation that you will know:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>based on the experience, year after year.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>based on the understanding of the weather.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>based on the nature of your soil.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="when-do-you-sow">When do you sow&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Prefer sowing when it’s cooler, especially during this month of summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="crops-progress-and-harvesting">Crops progress and harvesting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Again, through observation, you will need to check on your crops, checking for diseases, readiness for harvest and need of watering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, potatoes coming to flower are ready to harvest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw usually waits a couple of weeks when he sees the flower buds of the plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Another tip" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Another tip&lt;/p>&lt;p>When you water lettuce, wait it from the top like shown below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The water will then sink through the middle and it will give the full benefits to the lettuce.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="less-weeding">Less weeding&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The crops are growing and they leave little space to competing weeds.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>That isn’t the case for everything, of course. For example, bindweed can climb a crop and get its sunlight to continue to grow…&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-comfrey">What is comfrey&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Comfrey is a perennial herb that likes to grow in moist soil and in the shade.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s native from Europe and Asia and it was introduced into the USA in the 17th century, where it thrives today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Its tap root can sometimes reach 3 m in depth. The plant can grow as tall as 1.5 m and 2 m wide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s known as a dynamic accumulator, meaning that it mines the minerals and nutrients from the ground and draws it into the leaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The root acts like a straw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The leaves are therefore high in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium, which makes it a great liquid feed ingredient.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="usage">Usage&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It’s really easy to grow. You can obtain up to 3 cuts per year to using in mulching, liquid feed, compost ingredients and even as a herbal tea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To feed the soil, comfrey is really good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, to make the liquid feed, you simply need to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cut some leaves and tear them up into a bucket.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>press down the plant and add water to cover the materials&lt;/li>
&lt;li>leave it to ferment for 3 to 4 weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>strain it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dilute it with 1:10 ratio with water before applying it to the vegetables.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can mix the comfrey with stinging nettle, another mineral rich plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a mulch, you will simply apply the raw leave at the bottom of the plant you want to give a boost of nutrients and minerals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="propagation">Propagation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The propagation is easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>At the end of last year, I had little comfrey plants growing near the main plants (very likely from seeds).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I transplanted them in another location in my garden and they’re successfully growing since the spring began.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The other method is to dig out some mature plant and use the roots propagate.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You simply take the roots and cut them into 5 cm long pieces. Then Huw suggests to put them into medium modules to so that they can get started, and then you transplant them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m wondering if simply bearing the piece in the soil doesn’t just work as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The comfrey “bocking 14” variety is especially good at propagation from a small section of roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The best time to do this is late spring or early summer.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Amazing Way to Use NETTLES to Improve Seedling Success, by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/use-nettles-to-improve-seedling-success-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/use-nettles-to-improve-seedling-success-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/use-nettles-to-improve-seedling-success-huw-richards/images/2023-04-11-a-bowl-of-nettle-with-brown-sugar.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Amazing Way to Use NETTLES to Improve Seedling Success, by Huw Richards" />&lt;p>When you grow seedlings, good care of the plants is key. Using nettle, we can increase and reach success.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>FPJ stands for Fermented Plant Juice, obtained with brown sugar or vinegar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You use the liquid from that. When we use plants, we want to extract the minerals from those plants.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The process is simple to produce FPJ:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you sizzle the target plant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you add organic brown sugar&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you mix up and wait&lt;/li>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sugar will work as a solvent, extracting all the good stuff from the plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s even more important when you deal with a broad spectrum plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A broad spectrum plant is a plant that contains the 14–16 minerals plants need to grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The stinging nettle has all of them and the fermentation extraction provide the exact proportion the plants need!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-is-the-difference-between-the-water-method-and-the-sugar-method">What is the difference between the water method and the sugar method&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The rain water method works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main differences are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the concentration level of minerals that is higher with the brown sugar method.
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>consequently, the dilution will be more important: 500 to 1 instead of 10 to 1.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the shelf life is very good and the smell absent.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>To compare to making compost, it takes up to 2 years to obtain compost and even more time so that the soil assimilates the nutrients from it to give as food to the plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another advantage: you can apply the fermented juice directly and the plant assimilates within the minerals from it within hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, the making of FPJ takes very little time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Apart from the broad spectrum, the nettle will provide the boost of nutrients that the seeds need to get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just like a baby needs very close care and attention in the first 2 years of his life, the seedling needs the same care and attention to become a productive and healthy crop.&lt;/p>

But do you know a lot of weeds that are 10 times more useful than dreadful?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Huw details 7 reasons to grow more nettle in your vegetable garden is a great idea.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reason1-it-attracts-aphids">Reason #1: It attracts aphids&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The nettle is great to house all the aphids that are around the crops you are growing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So grow them close to the vegetables that aphids love.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>But I don’t like that!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I harvest nettle to eat and I don’t want to eat them…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have found that soaking the nettle in water with vinegar helps to detach all the aphids off the nettle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use a salad spinner to finish off the aphids that might hang on tight :)&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="reason2-a-wild-patch-of-nettle">Reason #2: A wild patch of nettle&lt;/h2>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? To help feed the wildlife. Whom am I thinking about? Ladybugs, of course!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ladybugs love aphids and aphids love nettle so ladybugs love nettles :)&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, many butterflies love nettles as it’s their main source of food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So grow a patch of nettle right away. Go find a patch into the wild and pull a few roots or a female nettle that has gone to seed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The male and female flowers occur on separate plants. Both flower sexes are green with yellow stamens, but the male flowers often have a purplish tinge and the female flowers tend to droop much more than the male flowers point upward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is an example of female nettle:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Dig a shallow trench and set the roots just like that.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="reason3-its-a-superfood">Reason #3: It’s a superfood&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It contains:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a lot of vitamins (A, C, K, severable B type)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of minerals, like calcium, iron&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a lot of proteins: in 100 grams of dried nettle, you find up to 30 grams of proteins.&lt;/li>

&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Cooking the nettle get rid of their sting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, simply washing the nettle with cold water or drying them won’t.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>When you pick nettle, pick the first 3 levels of leaves, which are tender and less fibrous, especially regarding the stem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most nutritious part is the seeds. They contain vitamin E and essential fatty acids.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A teaspoon per day will help quite a lot of your health.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reason4-its-a-bioindicator">Reason #4: It’s a bioindicator&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What a bioindicator? It’s what the presence of a wild plant in a certain area tells us about the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So nettle indicates that the soil is rich and moist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So wherever you see neetle, you’re very likely to be successful with your gardening.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reason5-it-serves-as-a-good-green-mulching">Reason #5: It serves as a good green mulching&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Nettle is loaded with nitrogen and potassium. So cutting nettle in bulk, you can then take it and spread it over a bed to boost the soil with the nutrients it contains.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steps are simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cut in pieces the nettles&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add them into a bucket (half full after pressing on them)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add water to the top of the nettle&lt;/li>
&lt;li>set a log or a stone over it to make sure the nettles are under water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>leave for 2 weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>use the liquid feed with a ratios 1 to 10: one part liquid feed and nine parts water.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Because nettle contains a high quantity of manganese and calcium, you can use them for plants lacking those nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reason7-its-a-great-compost-ingredient">Reason #7: It’s a great compost ingredient&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Of course, use young nettle if you don’t want them to grow in the compost. Or do you?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nettle brings huge improvement to the garden. When you search &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nettle&amp;#43;garden">&lt;em>nettle+garden&lt;/em> on Google&lt;/a>, you find 12M results!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reason8-it-makes-a-great-herbal-infusion">Reason #8: It makes a great herbal infusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To do so, cut some fresh nettle, wash them and pour boiling water over it.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I always eat the boiled nettles after 15 min. That way, you waste nothing :)&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;p>I know it was what replaced regular potatoes during the last great war, but I&amp;rsquo;d prefer eating wild plants than this&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>They’re easy to grow and they grow in the same space year after year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Apply a 4 cm layer of well broken-down compost and set each seed 30 cm apart (same for rows).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It can come back on its own if the weather is a little warmer. It will give you an early flourish in may when you transplant them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can use the petals as a safran-alternative in cooking or refreshing summer drinks. I wonder &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us3VENwEqNU">how this summer drink is made&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You enjoy them in the late spring and early summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They’re easy to grow, hardy and super productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can eat the shoots, meaning the top of the plant that is tender than the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to know that bread bean send out a deep root, so if you sow them in modules, you will deep-cell modules.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Huw grows them in containers to start with. He uses a container of 50 liters so it’s more manageable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He usually plants them in mid-February and the harvest comes, weather dependent, in May or early June.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After harvest, he reuses the compost for beans or squash&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In January, we don’t like going outside because it’s cozy inside. But, maybe, you’re like Huw and, in reality, you need to do some work in the garden. Let’s what&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4Weoqv6D6Y">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="january-is-a-synonym-to-preparation">January is a synonym to preparation.&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For example, you can start with spreading a load of compost on the beds where you don’t still have food growing, like cabbages or Swiss chard, very useful for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_gap">Hungry Gap&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you tidy your garden, you can reflect on the past year and find out what your plan will look like for the year to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, you don’t want to change your raised beds in the spring but during those winter months.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Using a tarmac rake" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Using a tarmac rake&lt;/p>&lt;p>Those rakes are heavier than the normal rake because of their end use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For spreading compost, they’re also great to help us spread up the compost.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Huw thinks that you need to apply a 5 cm to 7 cm compost layer on the raised beds yearly to replenish the nutrient content of the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>To put this in concrete numbers, a 5 cm layer of compost on a bed 100 m² garden (which is useable for the crops and excluding the alleys), you would need 5 metrics cube of compost or 5000 liters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where I live, to get that much compost would cost a fortune. At 10 euros a bag of 70 liters, it would cost 714 euros to cover the beds…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are places where you can find compost in bulk for a lower price. In my case, I can’t have it delivered because the minimum quantity is 10 tons!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could go rent a truck to hold about one ton, equivalent to 2000 liters, for about 115 euros (of which the compost costs just 26…).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting compost when you start feels like a challenge!&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>The when to put the compost depends on what you will grow. In general you will apply compost between autumn and winter. However, you will apply it also in the summer for the Brassicaceae.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="january-is-about-planning">January is about planning&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s a simple month but it’s a key one.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use the time to plan what you will grow, where, with what other crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Use the past year’s experience to adjust what didn’t work to try out something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I have a lot of ideas and I’m currently writing a journal of all I will do in the 2022–2023 year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me a year begins with autumn harvest time is over until the next one. So it falls around October.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, in summary, I picked up a lot of leaves from a nearby park (about 12 metric cubes) to not only cover my garden with &lt;em>a keep-warm blanket&lt;/em> but also make more compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also planted broad beans and garlic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I planted another kiwaï vine (&lt;em>Actinidia arguta&lt;/em>) because:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the first one we planted 3 years ago has provided its first fruits this year and it tastes so good.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It’s auto-fertile which is easier than the regular kiwi vine (we have a male and female and for 8 years, we had flowers but no fruits).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>&lt;/div>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="composting-tips">Composting tips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I’ll put here only what Huw hasn’t already shared in more recent vlogs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One tip that he hasn’t talked about a lot regarding nitrogen rich material: it’s urine. Of course, you will need to dilute it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At least, Huw is consistent between 2013 and 2022: he has been consistently saying to put 1 part green for 2 parts brown material in the compost bin. Also, he suggests again not to compost meat and dairy to keep the rats away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, it isn’t a good idea to compost pet manure, from cats and dogs, for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>First, I find that they really stink&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Second, Huw mentioned they contain microorganisms that you don’t want because of the diet of those pets (most carnivores).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>However, mostly vegetarian pets like guinea pigs and chicken can work fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The interesting fact is that the tip about to keep the compost bin warm. It makes me think of the tip from &lt;a href="../../../tag/charles-dowding">Charles Dowding&lt;/a>. He builds his compost bin fully closed on the side.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I have made 2 compost bins lately and I did make them fully closed, making sure to layer well the green and the brown to always oxygen to stay present.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>One thing he insists on is to keep too much rain away in the compost. Charles Dowding recommends the same. I therefore made some tops for my compost bins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, similarly to Charles Dowding: he recommends to ask around to gather more nitrogen-rich material, as it will be the resource that you will struggle to obtain in sufficient quantity (unless, you have a huge lawn 😅).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-pallet-compost">Building pallet compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw is building his compost bins from pallets without making sure the sides are full. See above for the model I’ve made.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="adding-weeds-in-the-compost">Adding weeds in the compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can, but as long as the weeds haven’t gone to seed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can put the weeds with seeds if you can build up a compost bin with a lot of heat. Above 55 °C, the seeds won’t survive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sand-in-compost">Sand in compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The advantage of sand would be to help with:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>drainage on clay soil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>root vegetables to grow nice and big because of the smooth texture.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>However, a soil that drains too much means a poorer water retention, which means you will need to water more often.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So maybe, I’d suggest to use it on the first 10 cm max, but always mixed with soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw didn’t put much anyways.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards&amp;rsquo;s channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>You can watch the vlog using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HkfLBgS7mY">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost represents a good soil amendment. You want to create your own to feed your garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make compost, the recipe is simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 parts of brown&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1 part of green (coffee ground, grass clippings)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the vlog, a friend of Huw suggests you need air to feed the material degrading.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, Charles Dowding said that as long as the compost heap remains moist but not wet, there will still be air in the material, coming from the way you pile up the material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Piling up the material is done in layers and the brown layers allow air in the pile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you live in a dry area, especially in summer, you will want to have a water source available to keep the compost moist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The moisture is what will keep the living organisms breaking down the material of the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my area, 1000 L of compost cost 150 euros if purchased in bags.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could get compost in bulk (26 euros for 2000 L organic-graded compost), but I&amp;rsquo;d need to rent a truck which is over 3 times the price of the compost…&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The two methods to get the compost hotter:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>building a 0.7 meter cube compost heap&lt;/li>
&lt;li>turning the compost&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-large-compost-heap">Why a large compost heap&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It does retain the moisture better, therefore, the micro-organisms&amp;rsquo; activity is increased.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, it will also consume more water as heat in a compost pile means life and life needs water, no matter the form or size.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-turning-really-worth-it">Is turning really worth it&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw suggests that the second way to turn the compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mixing the pile kickstarts the microbial activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I’m not sure I&amp;rsquo;d want to spend the energy turning the compost often just to keep the pile hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles Dowding&amp;rsquo;s method appeals to me more because you focus your energy to find more material, especially the green materials, to build up the compost pile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more green material you add, the more heat you can get and therefore, the faster you will have compost available.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What is true is the following: whether you turn the compost pile or not, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to compact your compost pile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Air is one of the key ingredients to make compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-third-way">A third way&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I said in my personal note, adding more nitrogen will increase heat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nitrogen means more green material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, what isn&amp;rsquo;t explained in the vlog is how do you get enough green material?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For that, I invite you to &lt;a href="../../../tag/compost/">read more on the topic of composting&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can find pallets for free at the back of supermarkets, or you could ask your neighbors: maybe one works where they have pallets to throw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, either:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>use a string to tie the bottom and top of each pallet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>use a wire if you want the structure to last. It would be the only purchase if you find free pallets.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A setup like this required 12 pallets.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kt6mIoKK6wE">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can call a garden “a garden” if you don’t make your compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compost is turning your waster into soil food.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-location-of-the-compost-bin">The location of the compost bin&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ideally, it needs to be in a corner and it needs to be in the share.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It needs to be close enough to the source of materials you will put in the bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, set your bin high up so you don’t have to climb &lt;em>a hill&lt;/em> to your garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="building-the-compost-bin">Building the compost bin&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many designs, but to my opinion, use pallets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re a family and don’t run a farm, don’t buy anything else other than screw or nails and a bit of wire. Look at &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/how-to-make-a-compost-bin-from-pallets-huw-richards/">this article detailing the process&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re running a farm, then this article won’t explain how to build compost bins optimized for large-scale operations. However, have a read of &lt;a href="../../../tag/charles-dowding/">the notes I took so far on the compost topic by Charles Dowding&lt;/a>. He runs a little business and he has a large 6-heap structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-materials">What materials&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s again simple. You have green material and brown material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw lists the most common greens and browns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Greens:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Horse and cow manure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Rabbit and Guinea Pig droppings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Used coffee ground&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kitchen vegetable scraps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Garden weeds which haven’t flowered&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grass clippings&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spent brewery grains&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Browns:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Huw makes it simple once more, despite the numerous recipes out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You want to simple mix 2 portions of brown with 1 portion of green.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you empty the material in the following order: brown over green.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will then build up a &lt;em>lasania&lt;/em> (e.g., layers) compost heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This method is called &lt;em>slow composting&lt;/em> because the heat is what speed up the composting process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, you need a lot more green materials in general and, trust me, it’s difficult to get plenty of material for hot compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problems-and-troubleshooting">Problems and troubleshooting&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Lack of nitrogen: if the compost takes over 12 months to be ready, add some more manure or greens.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Smell: if you put too much nitrogen, the heap might stink. You can easily solve that with an addition of a brown material.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Compost too wet: with too much water in the compost, the bacteria don’t thrive as well as if it was just moist. You can solve that with laying cardboard on top of the compost pile.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ideas-to-get-more-material-to-put-on-the-compost-pile">Ideas to get more material to put on the compost pile&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Ask your family, friends and neighbors to give away their compostable wastes by providing them with a container&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask your local coffee place to collect coffee grounds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ask your local shops to spare the cardboard boxes that you can easily use in your garden and on the compost bin.&lt;/li>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The potting bench includes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A working area made of a few wood planks where you can empty the compost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A table where you will put your tools
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Module trays of various sizes (deep-rooted for peas and beans, or shallower trays for general-purpose seeds)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Labels made from recycled materials&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="How to make your labels" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">How to make your labels&lt;/p>&lt;p>Huw mentioned yogurt pots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use the wood of an old crate.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A box for unfinished seed packets
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It’s very rare to sow a full packet of seeds, so keep those in a sturdy box, away from the humidity and sun.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Seed or multi-purpose compost" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Seed or multi-purpose compost&lt;/p>&lt;p>Huw had found that seed compost is too expensive for the actual benefits and multi-purpose compost does a good job for propagation.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="where-to-put-the-seed-trays">Where to put the seed trays&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One limitation of growing seedlings is a lack of space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The simple trick is to use shelves to rest the trays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have mice problem, do like Huw: set your most precious or less attractive-to-mouse seedlings higher!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="watering-seedlings">Watering seedlings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s a good idea to have a small watering can for fragile seedlings like lettuce.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or if you’re like me, I use a GLORIA Hobby 100 Pressure Sprayer (available &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3HDhcaX">in France&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3PtT1xK">in the UK&lt;/a>; &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3HGzSH5">in the US&lt;/a>, this brand doesn’t seem to be available.).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s quite handy as you can adjust the spray finely. Also, it’s sturdier than a bigger version sprayer (not the same brand) of 5 liters capacity. It broke twice after a year :( So I recommend a 1 liter like this Gloria model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re sowing on a warm month, after you have sown the seeds and watered the tray, cover it with a brown cardboard to retain the moisture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That way the seeds will germinate better (especially true for carrots as &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jamesprigioni/search?query=carrots">James Prigioni shared&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to check daily until you see the seedlings come out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you will need an area where you can take out your seedlings out to water them. On the shelves, it’s often not practical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/a-pallet-structure-for-watering-seedling.jpg"
loading="lazy"
alt="A pallet structure for watering seedling"

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The height is also ideal with standard 80 cm pallets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Checkout &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXR92xHfgic&amp;amp;t=988s">Charles Dowding’s vlogs&lt;/a> where he tells us more about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preparing-the-trays">Preparing the trays&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The steps are simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Fill the trays with compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Press down with your fingers on the compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill the trays with some more compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Water the tray on the ground if it’s quite dry&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create some holes where you will sow the seeds in each module&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sow enough seeds. See &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/early-summer-2018-at-homeacres-charles-dowding/#what-can-you-sow-in-the-beginning-of-june-in-the-uk">this article from a vlog of Charles Dowding&lt;/a> for a few examples.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gently fill the holes with some more compost&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Why before sowing" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Why before sowing&lt;/p>&lt;p>Huw likes to do this because once the seed is in the module, the water can displace it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you won’t need to water again after sowing if the weather is overcast.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="cold-frame">Cold frame&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A cold frame is a structure that you have outside with a glass top, like an old window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s the final stage to prepare the seedlings to acclimate to the lower temperatures, yet with no frost risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw mentioned it rather quickly at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have got a lot of old wooden windows that I’d like to use to build either a cold frame or a tiny greenhouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Late July Tour of a 100% Organic Kitchen Garden (Only Feed is Compost), by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/late-july-garden-tour-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/late-july-garden-tour-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;p>The garden produces a lot around midsummer.

&lt;p>You can plant tomatoes under the polytunnel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, I grow them without any protection. This year 2022, I haven’t taken care of them and the drought this past summer was really too hard to keep up with the watering.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-else">What else&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The end of July and early August is not only the time of harvest, but also the time to perform a well-planned succession of crops to get the most of the same area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you shouldn’t worry too much about crops rotation because it will save you a lot of hassle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It might not be true to all the gardens. You will need to find what works best for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have tomatoes in the same bed for eight years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have planted potatoes randomly (basically, where I had space) and I have very likely planted in the same place again. This year, we even had volunteered potato plants from an area where we had some last year.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Make a Compost Bin the Easy Way from Pallets, with Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/how-to-make-a-compost-bin-from-pallets-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/how-to-make-a-compost-bin-from-pallets-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;p>It’s easy to make your own.

&lt;p>Huw showcased a build with ready-to-use wood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will describe you a method with pallets&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The material lists:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>4 pallets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A few stainless steel screws or a sturdy wire of about 4 m.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The tools:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A handsaw or an electrical saw&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An electric screwdriver&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-build-the-version-with-screws">How to build the version with screws&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Remove the side feet of 2 pallets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Screw the modified pallets to the unmodified pallets using the 3 wood blocks.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Done!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;li>Cut 8 pieces of 50 cm of wire.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tie the wire around the top and bottom of each corner in the same way as the screwing method.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>I found the following interesting:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>With Huw’s build or mine, you don’t need to dig the corners in the ground. The bin simply rests on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Just like Huw, I prefer screws rather than nails.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you do use screws, maybe, I will go a bit further, use stainless steel screws, so that, if you take the bin apart, they won’t break on you from rusting.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Setup a &lt;em>tool share&lt;/em> with your neighborhood&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>List the tools each person has&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Share the tools when needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7iu4xgSu1Y">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s important to prioritize making your own compost the following tips are short-term adjustments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you aren’t making enough compost, by the end of the article, you will have an action plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="compost-levels">Compost levels&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first tip is to mix compost and top soil together to optimize the use of compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using 1 part good compost and 3 to 4 parts top soil is a good start.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mulching">Mulching&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you don’t have enough compost, mulching with alternatives happens to be a solution:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>woodchip&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dead leaves&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="About perennial plants" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">About perennial plants&lt;/p>&lt;p>They aren’t super nutrient hungry plants for using woodchips will suffice them.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="grass-clippings">Grass clippings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It’s the most underutilized material and you must get grass that wasn’t sprayed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go ask around your neighborhood and it’s very likely, if you don’t live in the city, that you will find people delighted to give away their grass clippings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The important thing when applying grass clipping is to apply it in thin layers, maximum two to three centimeters, especially in a UK-like climate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Grass clippings can make excellent slug accommodation and your plants won’t like it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, it can form a thick sludge that can smell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to be sure, sprinkling the grass on the soil will be fine. Perform the task in the morning of a sunny and the grass will decompose rather quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Applying grass is easy because it produces a lot and you can sprinkle it once a month.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In wood ash, you will find charcoal that, once broken up, can soak up all the nutrients and provide a slow release of those nutrients to the plants.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wood ash is high in potassium and phosphorus, both good for plant growth. However it’s missing nitrogen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That is when the coffee grounds come into the game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The myth about coffee ground being too acid isn’t a reality, according to Huw (others like &lt;a href="../../tag/charles-dowding/">Charles Dowding&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, when you brew the coffee, a lot of the acidity goes away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, you mix those two ingredients and you apply around the plants a sprinkle of the mix once a month. It doesn’t need to be too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If possible, do it right before some rain or watering. The water you will help the mix dissolve and go down the plant’s roots.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I do have half a dozen plants that I’m starting to propagate. The plant provides a huge quantity of nutrient-rich leaves. It can replace animal manure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The advantages of comfrey are numerous:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Letting comfrey flower is a fantastic bee restaurant.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It’s a dynamic accumulator: its long tap root brings up a lot of the minerals in the soil.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It’s a compost activator&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It is great for mulching beds&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="liquid-feed">Liquid feed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The advantage of liquid feed is that it provides soluble nutrients to the plant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using comfrey again, you make your own within 2 or 3 weeks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is huge not to rely on buying compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sacrifice some of you growing space to make your own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The biggest challenge is to gather material. I find this very true and it requires a lot of ingenuity to find sources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One key advice I’d give is to look close to you. You will be surprised about how much your neighborhood has to offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="bulk-compost">Bulk compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If it is available in your area and if it is approved for organic gardening, go for it. For Huw, it cost £40 per ton.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The closest I can get is 26 euros per ton, but I need to rent a truck to bring it home, so in the end, it cost 115 euros per ton&amp;hellip; I’m still very hesitant at the moment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can maybe purchase it as a group, hence lowering the cost. In my case, I can have it delivered but I will need a rather big storage area because they only deliver a minimum of 10 tons!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Art of Lazy Composting or how to Make High-Quality Compost the Simple Way, by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/the-art-of-lazy-composting-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/the-art-of-lazy-composting-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-12-06-the-art-of-lazy-title-overlaying-someone-handling-fennel.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Art of Lazy Composting or how to Make High-Quality Compost the Simple Way, by Huw Richards" />&lt;p>Sometimes, we think of making compost as a complex process, but, in reality, it’s easy to produce high-quality compost.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">About grass clipping&lt;/p>&lt;p>Apply it in a thin layer (2–3 cm maximum) because it can get sludgy if too thick.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I have found that mixing grass clippings with wood dust helps build a thin compost and helps to avoid the sludge.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="ratio-of-green-and-brown">Ratio of green and brown&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw tries to go for a 1 part green for 2 parts brown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, with lazy composting, he doesn’t overthink it. &lt;strong>But you will need to &lt;em>follow one key rule&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="you-need-diversity">You need diversity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Two or three ingredients aren’t enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more you add diverse sources of material, the more balance the compost will be in terms of pH and nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-a-bin-is-full">When a bin is full&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The only thing to do: press on the material to compact it a little.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put on some boots, climb in the bin and jump!&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="Jumping in the compost bin" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Jumping in the compost bin&lt;/p>&lt;p>Don’t do it if you didn’t build a strong structure 🤣&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Finally, cover the compost with cardboard to keep some rainfall off the compost pile. You want moisture but you don’t have anaerobic environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-is-lazy-compost-ready">When is lazy compost ready&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It will take longer, because it doesn’t get as hot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So instead, two to three months, it will take between six and eight months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw uses the technique of smelling the compost: if it smells like the forest floor, then it’s ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you can apply it to the beds as a cover for winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-about-rats">What about rats&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will get rats if you put in cooked food, diaries and bread in the compost bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And wouldn’t you prefer having them in the compost bin or your food storage?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-many-compost-bins">How many compost bins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Three bins appears to be a good target:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>one is usable for the garden&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one is full and is starting to break down&lt;/li>
&lt;li>one is being filled&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Therefore you will have compost available most of the time!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>These 8 Free Ingredients Will Bulk Out Your Compost Bins, by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/8-free-ingredients-will-bulk-out-compost-bins-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/8-free-ingredients-will-bulk-out-compost-bins-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-12-02-sheep-wool-as-a-compostable-material.jpg" alt="Featured image of post These 8 Free Ingredients Will Bulk Out Your Compost Bins, by Huw Richards" />&lt;p>A gardener can’t have too much compost and in fact you may not be able to create enough.

&lt;p>Use a very fibrous material like straw or small branches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, old nettle stems work well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will provide enough oxygen at the base and it’s key to help the microbes thrive and develop to break down the material in the compost.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To keep it, simple, Huw suggests to mix up the ingredients with a fork.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you can apply each ingredient in layers and if you have 2 ingredients in each category of green and brown material, spread each in several layers so no one is too thick.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="balance-the-green-and-brown-material">Balance the green and brown material&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw uses this ratio: for one bucket of green, he puts one or two buckets of brown.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But you don’t need to measure precisely the amount you put in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="invest-in-composting">Invest in composting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Composting is much better than investing in stock markets!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It doesn’t cost anything often except your time and ingenuity to source material around you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It helps you grow better and stronger vegetables that will help you reach more self-sufficiency in food.&lt;/p>

Huw shares a trick to do without.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vAwurGpl-M">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-source-of-the-idea">The source of the idea&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LizZorab/videos">Liz Zorab&lt;/a> inspired Huw with this concept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She uses a lot of woodchips in her garden alleys. After a while, she observed that the woodchips had turned into a dark broken-down material thanks to the traffic in the garden, the rain, the wind and the duck roaming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She then told herself that she could use this woodchip compost in her garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>then, you simply fork it from the pathways to the beds right beside it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="woodchip-hybrid-compost">Woodchip hybrid compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw suggests a hybrid solution, using kitchen scraps and other garden waste to create a nitrogen-rich compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="protect-wooden-beds">Protect wooden beds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you go for this technique, you will need to protect the wooden beds with an empty compost bag, for example.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Especially if you have grass paths, it’s ideal to apply a layer of cardboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It still allows earth contact between the soil life.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="calculate-the-volume-of-compost-it-can-create">Calculate the volume of compost it can create&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In Huw’s example, his pathway measures 3 meters long and 55 cm wide. He planned to put a 15 cm layer of material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He would get about 250 liters of compost in the end!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you have beds like Huw that measure 3 m by 1.2 m and you apply 3 cm of compost, 108 liters of compost. So with one alley, you can deal with the two beds surrounding it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="applying-the-materials">Applying the materials&lt;/h3>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>apply a 3 cm layer of woodchips, as the base layer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>throw on top of it any weeds that you find in the nearby beds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add more shredded cardboard.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add your vegetable waste or comfrey leaves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add kitchen scraps (but add something else on top like leaves or more cardboard) .6. finish with a good soaking if you lack rain.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcmR8KbJzH8">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It happens very often that people think that grasse clippings aren’t good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Because if you apply a too thick layer, it creates a sludge and an anaerobic environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In practice, you don’t want to apply a layer of more than 2 cm to 3 cm thick.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="multiple-mulch-options">Multiple mulch options&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The benefits of mulching with grass are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>weed suppression (if you use grass with no seeds of course)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>moisture retention&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If slugs aren’t a worry for you, you can mulch your beds with a 2–3 cm layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If slugs are a concern, you can still use grass but sprinkle no more than 1 cm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s easier to apply it when the plants are small.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adding grass as mulch will build up organic matter because one molecule of organic matter holds up to four molecules of water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will help the long-term health and water retention capabilities of the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="mulching-potatoes">Mulching potatoes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw is growing potatoes in containers. He adds a good 5 cm layer of grass on top to keep the moisture and hope that he won’t need to water them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He tops up with more grass as it starts breaking down.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="watering">Watering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Apparently, watering is more effective. Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you have a dry soil, the water will often run off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With grass clippings, it simply won’t. The grass captures the water and slows it down to the soil.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Checkout &lt;a href="https://en.jadam.kr/">Youngsan’s website&lt;/a> for more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>JADAM liquid solution has a balance pH and you need to apply it throughout the plant’s life, up to the flowering or fruiting stage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the case of grass, here is the process Huw suggests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Rain water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Leaf mold or really old homemade compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An opaque container&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The procedure is simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fill the container to 70% with fresh grass nearly to the top while pushing down gently to put as much as possible&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Add the water to cover a little bit over the grass.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Press down the grass if necessary&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Sprinkle the leaf mold&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Two weeks after, you can use the JADAM liquid in a 1:30 ratio. As it ages, it gets better and therefore, you will need to adjust the ratio: see &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/easy-low-cost-plant-feed-to-boost-vegetables-huw-richards/#dilution-ratio">the details here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The interesting thing is that you can top up with water the container for years while you keep the solids in. Adding additional organic matter of the same plant (in this case grass clippings) is also an option as the original matter has decomposed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EASY Low-Cost Plant Feed to Boost Crop Yields &amp; Health, by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/easy-low-cost-plant-feed-to-boost-vegetables-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/easy-low-cost-plant-feed-to-boost-vegetables-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-24-a-cut-plastic-bottle-filled-with-some-brown-liquid.jpg" alt="Featured image of post EASY Low-Cost Plant Feed to Boost Crop Yields &amp; Health, by Huw Richards" />&lt;p>Instead of buying expensive and dangerous plant feed, learn to make your own now.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-is-jadam">What is JADAM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>JADAM organic farming comes from Youngsang Cho who wrote a few books on the topic: &lt;a href="https://en.jadam.kr/">check out his website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the teaching is that the plant is its own fertilizer. By creating a liquid feed, you have the optimum elements to grow strong crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>It’s game-changing in a world where many think we need industrial fertilizers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you can make a liquid feed with so little effort and at a price that beats anything, why would one go for industrial fertilizers?&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As an example: a fruit tree will produce leaves and fruits that will fall to the ground, decompose and feed the tree for the next year. JADAM uses the same principle.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="optimum-liquid-amendment">Optimum liquid amendment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To make any liquid amendment, you need the plant fresh to make the liquid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to use the entire crop, not just the leaves or the roots.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>That means that you won’t be able to make this amendment until the crops are growing already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That might be tricky if your don’t have a lot of the particular plant.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="how-to-create-a-high-quality-feed">How to create a high-quality feed&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since you need to use the whole plant, you will use what you eat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news is you don’t need that many.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Don’t worry about sacrificing some of the crops!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="one-caveat">One caveat&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>JADAM is designed for big agriculture operation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you have a little garden, how are you going to make all the specific liquid feeds for your crops?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Huw suggests to create a group or family of amendments. For example, make a Braceassus amendment for the family of cabbages, broccolis and so on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disclaimer: he hasn’t tried and will tell us how this work out.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>This caveat came to my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m blessed to have a local free source of 5 liter containers. I get them from buying sauerkraut in them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We eat a lot and we can get about 1 container per month from November to March.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="the-recipe">The recipe&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Decide what plant matter you will use.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cut and smash the big piece to help with the breakdown.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fill the container full.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add soft water to cover the plant matter.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sprinkle a handful of leaf mold or good compost.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>You don’t need to mix the leaf mold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, put on the container lid loosely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Done!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wait two weeks before you can use in a dilution&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dilution-ratio">Dilution ratio&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can use a 1:30 ratio with soft water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the JADAM solution ages, you will need to increase the ratio.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Dilution ratios (approximate): 2 weeks: 1:30 1 month: 1:50 3 months: 1:100 6 months: 1:200 1 year: 1:400/1:500&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Use it as a supplement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn’t about getting massive crops but more about healthy and nutritious-densed crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="more-traditional-feeds">More traditional feeds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can continue using:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>comfrey feed to help tomatoes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>or grass feed for seedlings (see &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcmR8KbJzH8">GRASS - The Most Valuable FREE Resource for Growing Food&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-maintain-your-jadam-liquid-feed">How to maintain your JADAM liquid feed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As you extract liquid from the container, never take any of the solid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the liquid levels go down, top it up with more water and more of the exact same crop.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="It will be smelly :)" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">It will be smelly :)&lt;/p>&lt;p>Not everything has to be aerobic.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>It’s easy to fallback to JADAM liquid feed&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we saw, since it’s easy to make, and rather fast to become ready, we can rely on this method.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="transplanting-with-jadam-liquid-feed">Transplanting with JADAM liquid feed&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you transplant a plant, adding some JADAM liquid feed to the water used will help the plant get the minerals and nutrients it needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, get into the habit to use JADAM liquid feed once or twice a month when you’re watering. See &lt;a href="#dilution-ratio">the ratio above&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="takeaway">Takeaway&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Start making your JADAM liquid feed now, no matter where you’re at when you read this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will make more comments about the technique in a year time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>7 FREE Tricks to Grow Food With Limited Compost, by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/7-free-tricks-to-grow-food-with-limited-compost-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/7-free-tricks-to-grow-food-with-limited-compost-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-23-7-free-tricks-to-grow-food-with-limited-compost-huw-richards.jpg" alt="Featured image of post 7 FREE Tricks to Grow Food With Limited Compost, by Huw Richards" />&lt;p>Having enough compost can challenge any gardener. Let’s what Huw what it suggests to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzonE2AmGmw">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trick1-consider-a-_break-year_">Trick 1: Consider a &lt;em>break year&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is a year you don’t put any compost on an area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn’t something you would do to start with, but rather you use this trick down the line after a few years of mulching.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trick2-dedicate-an-area-to-crop-that-doesnt-need-a-lot-of-nutrients">Trick 2: Dedicate an area to crop that doesn’t need a lot of nutrients&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For example, legumes, like filed beans, adapt well to poorer soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trick3-compost-directly-on-the-beds">Trick 3: Compost directly on the beds&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When you apply compost, you add carbon, nitrogen, microbes and nutrients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But simply said, compost is old plants decomposed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is what Huw calls &lt;em>Chop, Move and Drop&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s like &lt;a href="#trick-3-compost-directly-on-the-beds">trick 3&lt;/a>, but, in this case, you need to apply it in a thin layer (2 cm to 3 cm) to avoid rotting.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="trick5-jadam-microbial-solution">Trick 5: JADAM microbial solution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will find the images of the recipe &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5TvNwDeEzU">in this short vlog &lt;em>Do This With Potatoes To BOOST Soil &amp;amp; Plant Health&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and goes as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The tools:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a square piece of fabric&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The ingredients:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2 small boiled potatoes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a handful of leaf mold&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 g of sea salt&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Instructions:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>cut the piece of fabric&lt;/li>
&lt;li>smash the potatoes on the fabric&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add the leaf mold&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tie the fabric into a sachet&lt;/li>
&lt;li>put in an opaque container&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pour and knead the sachet with rain water (or soft water)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>add the salt&lt;/li>
&lt;li>mix well&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cover&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>After 1 or 4 days, depending on the weather, you will see bubbles creating, which means microbes multiply in the solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To use the solution,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>take 1:20 of the solution mixed with rain water (or soft water).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>apply it to the garden&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It provides:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a big boost to your plants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a kick-start to the microbial activity&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and a help to break down the material into your soil.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If you apply the solution once a month in the poorest beds, it’s going to make a lot of difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trick6-trench-planting">Trick 6: Trench planting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It consists in making a trench in which you will dump kitchen waste.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then you cover it with a little bit of soil and plant whatever you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the plant grows, the kitchen waste will be already decomposing and it will provide to the plant the nutrients from that degradation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="trick7-plant-fermentation">Trick 7: Plant fermentation&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Then use your lawn mower to mix the leaves and grass clippings together to obtain a 50/50 mixture great to put on the compost heap.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbwVlBzAGZU">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="starting-disclaimer">Starting disclaimer&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No everybody has access to the same resources and the same amount of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, we have different numbers of spaces to make and store the compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this vlog, Huw showcases *his method to become self-sufficient in compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="definition-of-self-sufficiency">Definition of self-sufficiency&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It can be different for all of us. To Huw, the goal is to create all the mulching compost he needs for the garden and for transplanting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, at the time of the shooting, he still purchases seed compost (e.g., potting compost) because he hasn’t perfected his own yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Self-sufficiency is a journey that takes time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="types-of-compost">Types of compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We find the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>standard compost, the one you apply in a layer of 2 to 3 cm each year on your beds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>inoculated compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nutrishous compost&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and the fourth one can be in &lt;em>The Living Soil Handbook&lt;/em> from Jesse Frost.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It’s available &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3EMDfKB">in France&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3VeWYIq">in the UK&lt;/a> and the&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/3ENTBmn"> US&lt;/a>. It provides clear and detailed tips to build up life in your soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jesse describes the four types of composts in depth.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-much-compost">How much compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Huw’s favorite bed size is a 3 m by 1.2 m with a depth of 20 cm (rough estimate from the vlog).&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a mulch layer of 2 cm, it will require 100 liters of compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Count the number of beds you have and time that by 100 liters. It will give the compost amount you need for your garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, take a 20% extra so you’re sure not to run out.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Of course, not everyone can build a garden with the same rectangular frame.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For instance, my garden has a weird shape, so the beds are rarely rectangular.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So make your beds with creativity, using the space efficiently,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, using the material you have available for free can decrease your bill.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="making-compost">Making compost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Remember: compost is decomposed material, it means that the original materials have been broken down and you will get about one third in the volume of what you put in on the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, this ratio is dependent on what you put on the heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you look at the compost you need to make, you might feel overwhelmed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So Huw suggests to spread the load.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="making-compost-in-the-alleys">Making compost in the alleys&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Huw spreads all kinds of material in the alleys between the beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It equals to about 10 cm to 15 cm layer. When it&amp;rsquo;s ready, he sifts it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That way he can get about 200 liters of compost, enough for the two beds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="chicken-compost">Chicken compost&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>The advantage of chicken compost is that the chicken will eat the seeds they find in the bedding.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="worm-compost">Worm compost&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This compost is usually very nutritious. It’s used more as a supplement rather than a sole use for your garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hot-beds">Hot beds&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It’s more a gardening technique than a compost making technique.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, it’s about using the warmth of compost in the making to grow vegetables you wouldn’t grow in certain times of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And at the end, you have harvested the crops that grew in those hot beds and you will find yourself with a huge amount of great quality compost.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Huw thinks it could work well on the previously mentioned deep mulch chicken compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Always be on the lookup" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Always be on the lookup&lt;/p>&lt;p>When you make your compost, you will need to be mindful to the material you can gather to make your compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>People throw a lot of things that can go on the compost heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’m preparing to look around my area to see who would be giving away their grass clippings, saving them time as they don’t have to go the local public waste factory.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="woodchips">Woodchips&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Woodchips come not only from the freshly cut branches, but also the sawmill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first type, called fragmented rameal wood, comes from the small branches. Their width shouldn&amp;rsquo;t exceed 7 cm in diameter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those branches contain more nutrients than bigger pieces and, with two to three years, you can use it as compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="saw-dust">Saw dust&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Saw dust creates a fine texture because of its natural form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So using compost with a good portion of saw dust might just be the good recipe for potting compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And you may wonder if it isn’t too high in carbon and that it might suck the nitrogen out of the ground. Well, it’s always a matter of balance. You won’t apply saw dust as is the beds. You will mix it with some green material and let it degrade.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Having used saw dust the past year to make my compost from grass clipping mixed the saw dust and kitchen waste, I have to say that the result in terms of texture and look seems promising.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will use it next year and I’ll report my findings.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="A word of caution" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">A word of caution&lt;/p>&lt;p>Make sure the wood saw dust you collect is free from preservatives before you plan to put it on a compost heap.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="dead-leaves">Dead leaves&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Same as saw dust, dead leaves are available and cheap, and mixed well with green materials, you can create a great compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>I use leaves as my winter duvet for the garden in a 10 cm to 20 cm layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I don’t have the best orientation in the winter with about four and a half hours of sun (weather permitting), I don’t plant anything during the winter months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year was my first year applying this covering and by the end of this year harvest, I can tell you, the leaves have all disappeared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think it has helped to create a smoother soil, from which I can more easily pull out the weeds.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Glues on cardboard&lt;/p>&lt;p>Huw tells glues are almost always strach-based, meaning they come from a plant-based source.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, using cover crops produces a lot of materials to bulk up the compost heap.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out the channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/davidthegood">David the Good&lt;/a> as he explains it in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidthegood/search?query=cover%20crop">these vlogs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="set-goals-that-you-can-attain">Set goals that you can attain&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The first challenge is to gather the materials. Finding a place to pile it up won’t be a challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So for your first year, brainstorm:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>where you can get the materials,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>then build your heap using wood pallets&lt;/li>
&lt;li>finally, start filling the first heap&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Within a year, you will have your very own homemade compost.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>My goal for the 2022–2023 year is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Finding more sources of grass clippings closer to home, even if I can get a trailer-full of it from the mowing my company loan (I know nobody spray anything on it).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Asking my local organic store for coffee grounds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Getting more saw dust from the local sawmill that is only 5 min from my house.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Growing more comfrey because it gives out huge leaves!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Kathleen Henderson, &lt;a href="https://rootsandboots.com">from Roots and Boots&lt;/a>, shared in &lt;a href="https://rootsandboots.com/intercropping-lettuce-with-garlic/">an article on the topic&lt;/a> listing the advantages of intercropping lettuce and garlic in three points:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>increased yield: grow more in less space&lt;/li>
&lt;li>weed control: vegetable like lettuce help to block out weeds around slower growing plants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pest management: intercropping increases biodiversity in the garden, which can help to confuse harmful insects&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;h2 id="why">Why&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even if the most common way to harvest garlic is to wait that the bottom has turned brown, there are two other types of garlic harvest:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Early harvest: when you harvest earlier, the garlic is much juicer and has a better flavor exchange in cooking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Green garlic: you can then enjoy garlic up twelve weeks before the usual harvest time&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The latter will be the focus of the following notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before moving on, remember that late May is within that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Gap">hungry gap&lt;/a> period: it is the time of the year when you are finishing your winter crops, but the spring crops haven&amp;rsquo;t yet yielded fruits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the hungry gap, alongside with green garlic, you can find purple broccoli and asparagus to fill the leanest period of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-green-garlic">What is green garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is similar to a leak.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-green-garlic">Benefits of green garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you forget to sow garlic in the autumn, you can still sow it in the spring and get green garlic, even if you may not get a mature garlic (it is actually harder to &amp;ldquo;bulb-up&amp;rdquo; garlic when planted in spring).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another benefit is to set free garden space for another crop, like shallots. Then you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait all the way to the end of June / early July to set the new crop.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cooking-and-green-garlic">Cooking and green garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Green garlic is more like a leak, in flavor, but sweeter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, green garlic with potatoes gives an interesting taste, because of the sweetness of garlic when young.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-idea-with-closer-spacing">Growing idea with closer spacing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What about sowing the cloves closer, like every 5 cm instead of every 10 cm, so that, when the green garlic harvest comes, you harvest every other one to leave the other one to grow fully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then in the same space, you will get both green and mature garlic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Simple Way to Becoming Self-Sufficient in Food, by Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/the-simple-way-to-food-self-sufficiency-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/the-simple-way-to-food-self-sufficiency-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-02-a-vegetable-garden.jpg" alt="Featured image of post The Simple Way to Becoming Self-Sufficient in Food, by Huw Richards" />&lt;p>Growing your own food is a great skill to learn. You can start on a small area to become familiar with the basics. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the first steps to become more self-sufficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards&amp;rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HmQqsTM8co">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="food-self-sufficiency-a-definition">Food self-sufficiency: a definition&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is the goal to grow your own food you need to eat every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is becoming independent and not needing anything from shops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It requires a lot of careful planning and can become overwhelming if you set yourself goals that are too high.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, you will have to make some sacrifices, not only regarding the food you can actually be self-sufficient with, but also the time you have to grow your own food and what you can grow in your garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is about asking oneself the question: what is the ultimate goal of food self-sufficiency?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-start">How to start&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Set small targets to start that are easy to reach and move on to more ambitious ones, without ever going too fast too soon. Otherwise you will crush the goal of self-sufficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember: self-sufficiency doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen overnight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, self-sufficiency doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you have to grow food 365 days a year. Instead, try to perform work to reach part-time self-sufficiency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growing some food for a specific period that you know will be more doable in &lt;em>your situation&lt;/em> might just be enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>you can grow salads from April to November and be self-sufficient in salad that period&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you can grow onions and be self-sufficient through autumn and winter&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-group-crops-to-start-with">What group crops to start with&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>They are easy to grow and versatile in the kitchen.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="salads">Salads&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;em>cut and come again&lt;/em> salads are the best (take what you need in leaves while leaving the plant produce).&lt;/p>

&lt;li>or a polytunnel&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="potatoes">Potatoes&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough garden space, grow them in 25 to 30 liter containers and start harvesting them from mid-June.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They are easy to store through winter. It is done in a dark and cool place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="onions">Onions&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is really easy to grow and to store them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The production could give enough to last from late summer to winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="kale">Kale&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can start kale in mid-March to April and expect to harvest leaves from mid to late June all the way through winter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And even in the next year, in March, April and May, you will get a lot of flowers shoots that will give you more food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a lot of varieties to choose from, so if you are not keen with the curly kale, you can try others, like the red Russian kale.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="annual-herbs">Annual herbs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Even if perennial herbs (meaning living for several years) would be easy to pick, we will gain more satisfaction from fresh herbs during the growing season, like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>dill&lt;/li>
&lt;li>parsley&lt;/li>
&lt;li>coriander.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-much-do-i-need-to-grow-something">How much do I need to grow something&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Everyone is different so you are the one who can know how much you and your household eat throughout the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, look at the core staples you eat in your case throughout the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, estimate:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>how much you need of a staple per week
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>for example 2 bulbs of garlic per week&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how long you need that staple: 1 month, 6 months, all year
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>for example 4 months&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So in the example, that gives us 2 bulbs x 4 months (12 weeks) = 24 plants of garlic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Be aware that you will need to think about storage for some food if you want to have it available for longer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You need to take into account the potential failures, so add 20 to 25% to the estimate, so in the example, we will need an extra 6 plants of garlic.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal tip" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal tip&lt;/p>&lt;p>I have started in August 2022 to track the quantity of the food purchases we make.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is easy today to scan a grocery ticket and convert it using an image to text online tool like &lt;a href="https://www.onlineocr.net/">Online OCR&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it is not perfect depending on your receipt quality, it helps a lot to build a journal of your purchases week by week and only take a couple of minutes for each ticket.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a while, you will be able to build a predefined list of produces you buy regularly and you might not need to scan and convert anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can track your purchases using &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hScfACex3yjX-Nu5FUy4wTN7csYKyGf75TEJKwAem9A/edit?usp=sharing">this free Google sheet template&lt;/a> over a month or a year (you will need to be patient for a year long tracking).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please feel free to use it as a template. At the end, it will be very quick to identity how much you need from a given crop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will need to adjust the values in the &amp;ldquo;Constants&amp;rdquo; tab as you go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a while, it will be easy to input your purchase if you buy by the season and if you are regular. &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/page/contact-me/">Contact me if you have questions&lt;/a> on how to use the sheet or if you want me to demo it in a video.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Test different varieties: some may not work while others can be very successful. Don&amp;rsquo;t beat yourself up if the first try doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also embrace seasonality: don&amp;rsquo;t try to push against the natural cycle. Tomatoes are a summer crop, while cabbage and squashes are more a winter one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What benefits do you get from eating out of season?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>you will have more fresh produce to eat&lt;/li>
&lt;li>you will have to be more creative on how to use the crops you get. See &lt;a href="https://farmerandchef.co.uk/blog">Huw and Sam&amp;rsquo;s blog for recipes&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Look at what is special about every single season and you will become of more self-sufficient.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
