With a few tips, Charles explains us how to speed up the process to obtain a rich compost material.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhBvEG_Pg8Y">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It’s used to decompose the woodchips by using this system and making sure the woodchips are properly watered.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Don’t burry woodchip&lt;/p>&lt;p>Since Charles is the no-dig advocate, he doesn’t bury the woodchips and he warms us that if you dig and burry the woodchips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They will suck the nitrogen out of the rooting zone and it will deprive your plants and vegetables of what they need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the surface, it’s fine because the plants and vegetables will set their root under the woodchips.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>After breaking down a pile of woodchip compost from a bioreactor, you get the following.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Later in the vlog, Charles explains more about the pipes in the bioreactor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s supposed to help maintaining air in the heap. But is it necessary?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Woodchip by its natural structure will allow air to be present, hence why we can add it to the compost heap to give the greener material &lt;em>a breath&lt;/em> and prevent sludge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In that other bioreactor, Charles added chicken manure and the temperature is consequently higher than the uncovered pile described below.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With fresh fragmented fresh wood (which is what Charles presented, not the dry woodchips), you will get some activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, there is no problem with conifer wood, in Charles’s experience. He feels that the pH level with that kind of wood, once well decomposed, isn’t an issue. I have found that to be true as well for the few years I used them from a source of Douglas wood.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, with a pile, you will need to water it if you don’t get enough rain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more green the material you get in the woodchip, the faster they will decompose. It isn’t more true in the summer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Charles used a lawnmower to the breakdown of the woodchips after 4–6 months of winter decomposing.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Green material will decompose faster than the wood pieces, and after 9 months, Charles found out that there are a lot of woodchips left.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When I say &lt;em>regular&lt;/em> woodchips, it means with no green, in particular the ones you can get in the sawmill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It decomposes slower, but it will provide some useful materials with time.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="patience-is-key">Patience is key&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can get the woodchip to a pure humus state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even if you can use water and moisture to speed up the process, you will need significantly more time to decompose woodchips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you reach the humus state, then you have a very good addition for the garden.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal note" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>From what I saw, it seems that the bioreactor setup speed up the decomposition, very likely because you have got a managed structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With a pile lying on the ground, you can’t keep the moisture has easily. And watering the pile may use more water than the bioreactor contained environment.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-use-woodchips">How to use woodchips&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Charles uses woodchips in 4 ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>pathways&lt;/li>
&lt;li>woody material for compost heap (when it’s a few months old and already decomposing)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>burning it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>filling a bed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="pathways">Pathways&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Woodchips on pathways has several advantages :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>it keeps your boots clean&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it will eventually provide a source of food for your plants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>it helps to keep the soil firm, not compact.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="filling-a-bed-with-2-year-old-woodchips">Filling a bed with 2-year-old woodchips&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To finish, how does it compare to grow vegetables in 2-year-old woodchips “&lt;em>compost&lt;/em>” to regular homemade compost?&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-warning" id="Big pieces of wood and slugs" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Big pieces of wood and slugs&lt;/p>&lt;p>Be careful of the large wood piece that can shelter slugs…&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>What Charles experienced was a very poor start, with a lot of yellow leaves for 6 weeks.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 6 weeks, Charles thinks that the roots got through the layer of woodchips and it ended to be successful, even if less productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Try it yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Try to get the smallest sized woodchips, if you can. But it’s hard to &lt;em>choose&lt;/em> what you get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, use the lawnmower technique.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
