Plus, you will enjoy deliciously-spiced meals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr3ZxWexS5c">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="does-it-work">Does it work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But from Charles’s comments, it seems a hard discount garlic head may give a strange harvest.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal note&lt;/p>&lt;p>Using organic garlic heads may yield better results. I will try a non-organic head from a local farmer’s shop and an organic head from our local organic supermarket Satoriz.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;h2 id="do-not-leave-your-garlic-in-the-soil-too-long">Do not leave your garlic in the soil too long?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-judge-the-readiness-of-garlic-charles-dowding/">you checked the garlic head is ready&lt;/a>, you should not leave it too long in the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>the outer skin can decay and the garlic turns bad or the garlic may rot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the cloves can start sprouting and you will see a lot of new garlic shoots&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>It is a rampant fungal disease that infects the entire Allium family, including garlic and onions. If left unchecked, the disease can result in smaller-than-usual bulbs and limited growth of a plant. Garlic infected by rust is still edible and unless the infection was severe, you should get a decently sized bulb at harvest time. There’s no need to prematurely pick your garlic crop unless the entire plant is brown and dead. (Like “dead dead”, not “ready and ripe” dead.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>They don’t need any special space.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It can be done simply with the following steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>Add some water&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Remove the water&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wash the seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Let them dry for 2-3 weeks in direct sunlight&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Store the seeds in a closed paper bag.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Up to 5 years, if kept in a cool and dry place.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
