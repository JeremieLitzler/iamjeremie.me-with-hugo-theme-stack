&lt;p>I find that some crops, like lettuce and strawberries, struggle with pests, named slugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have tried in the past growing shallot around strawberries and I think it worked to keep the slugs away, far better than ash, beer traps or egg shells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kathleen Henderson, &lt;a href="https://rootsandboots.com">from Roots and Boots&lt;/a>, shared in &lt;a href="https://rootsandboots.com/intercropping-lettuce-with-garlic/">an article on the topic&lt;/a> listing the advantages of intercropping lettuce and garlic in three points:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>increased yield: grow more in less space&lt;/li>
&lt;li>weed control: vegetable like lettuce help to block out weeds around slower growing plants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>pest management: intercropping increases biodiversity in the garden, which can help to confuse harmful insects&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My favorite benefit is clear the third one.&lt;/p>

You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asVqiG3f66M">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even if the most common way to harvest garlic is to wait that the bottom has turned brown, there are two other types of garlic harvest:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Early harvest: when you harvest earlier, the garlic is much juicer and has a better flavor exchange in cooking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Green garlic: you can then enjoy garlic up twelve weeks before the usual harvest time&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The latter will be the focus of the following notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before moving on, remember that late May is within that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Gap">hungry gap&lt;/a> period: it is the time of the year when you are finishing your winter crops, but the spring crops haven&amp;rsquo;t yet yielded fruits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the hungry gap, alongside with green garlic, you can find purple broccoli and asparagus to fill the leanest period of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-green-garlic">What is green garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is similar to a leak.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-green-garlic">Benefits of green garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you forget to sow garlic in the autumn, you can still sow it in the spring and get green garlic, even if you may not get a mature garlic (it is actually harder to &amp;ldquo;bulb-up&amp;rdquo; garlic when planted in spring).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another benefit is to set free garden space for another crop, like shallots. Then you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait all the way to the end of June / early July to set the new crop.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cooking-and-green-garlic">Cooking and green garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Green garlic is more like a leak, in flavor, but sweeter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, green garlic with potatoes gives an interesting taste, because of the sweetness of garlic when young.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-idea-with-closer-spacing">Growing idea with closer spacing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What about sowing the cloves closer, like every 5 cm instead of every 10 cm, so that, when the green garlic harvest comes, you harvest every other one to leave the other one to grow fully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then in the same space, you will get both green and mature garlic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Grow Garlic, simple steps for HUGE yields, with Huw Richards</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-grow-garlic-simple-steps-for-huge-yields-huw-richards/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-grow-garlic-simple-steps-for-huge-yields-huw-richards/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-09-30-a-dry-garlic.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to Grow Garlic, simple steps for HUGE yields, with Huw Richards" />&lt;p>Garlic is a healthy crop to grow for your meal.

&lt;h2 id="3-things-to-know-before-growing-garlic">3 things to know before growing garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Garlic exists in 3 categories: softneck, hardneck and elephant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Garlic is very hardy crop demanding very little attention after planting&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The green stem can be consumed! See below&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="elephant-garlic">Elephant garlic&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It is considered as a perennial crop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are massive, compared to the regular soft or hardneck garlic.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hardneck-garlic">Hardneck garlic&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This category tends to have larger cloves and is said to be tastier than softneck garlic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However the bulbs don&amp;rsquo;t last as long as softneck garlic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, hardneck garlic is better suited for cold climates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, hardneck garlic produced some beautiful scapes (the top of the stem that will flower and that you need to cut off and eat!)&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="softneck-garlic">Softneck garlic&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Even if they produce smaller bulbs, there are more cloves in one head.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you live in a warmer climate, softneck garlic is a good choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="planting">Planting&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="when">When&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It starts from mid-October and mid-December.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any earlier and you may lose your plants over a really cold winter if they have developed too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="jli-notice jli-notice-tip" id="Personal thought" >
&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal thought&lt;/p>&lt;p>That probably means that planting from mid-September (like &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/grow-garlic-easy-with-no-dig-tips-for-harvest-charles-dowding/">Charles Dowding suggested&lt;/a>) may be only possible under a polytunnel or greenhouse.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Any later, you risk your bulbs to be underdeveloped.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="spacing">Spacing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>You can plant each clove quite close to each other, between 7 cm to 10 cm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also, to increase the amount of garlic planted, you can use the diagonal method:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Also, plant your garlic in various areas (3-4 locations, if possible) rather than just one place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing">Growing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most important thing is the plant focuses its energy on the bulb, not the flowering stem (see &lt;a href="#hardneck-garlic">above&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If there is a period in spring and early summer with no rain, give garlic a heavy soaking.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="harvest">Harvest&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It happens when the bottom 50% of leaves have turned brown (or end of June).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can also enjoy garlic from late April into may. This is called &lt;em>green garlic&lt;/em> where you can eat not only the bulb but also the stem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Garlic doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be dried to eat it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="drying-and-storing">Drying and storing&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Let garlic dry for a full day under the sun&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then move it to dry in the airy place, hanging or lying down on a table, for 4 to 6 weeks&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After the drying, cut off the stem, leaving 5 cm like shown below

&lt;p>To grow more food from the same patch of land, planting beans following harvest is a good idea&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To store garlic, you can also ferment it with salt and water. Huw Richards talked about a recipe with honey and garlic that can be kept for a year. I&amp;rsquo;ll look into this.&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="jli-notice-title">Personal experience&lt;/p>&lt;p>I tried it with carrots and it tastes really good, and amazingly, the spicy side of garlic is done after 1 month of fermentation.&lt;/p>&lt;/div>

&lt;h3 id="white-rot">White rot&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=white%20rot%20disease">White rot&lt;/a> affects the Allium family, which the garlic is belonging to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you do get this, to avoid it, just don&amp;rsquo;t grow garlic in that same place for 3 to 4 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rust">Rust&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This disease is far less of a problem.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simply, remove the worst affected leaves. Then when it comes to harvest, remove the outer layer and the garlic will be fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As long as you take care of the soil, rust goes away. You can also apply lactic acid bacteria using a spray.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Plant Garlic From Start to Finish, by The Dutch Farmer</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-plant-garlic-start-to-finish-the-dutch-farmer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-plant-garlic-start-to-finish-the-dutch-farmer/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-09-29-a-garlic-and-some-cloves.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to Plant Garlic From Start to Finish, by The Dutch Farmer" />&lt;p>Step by step, Moreno shows how to plant this crop successfully.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Garlic is not too difficult to grow and it stores well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Growing outdoors can bring rust much more than under a polytunnel and greenhouse. Also, it will grow bigger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, there is no real solution to rust.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Softneck garlic is harvested about 2-3 weeks earlier than hardneck garlic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A feature that you may like from the hardneck garlic is the cloves tend to be bigger and therefore easier to peel.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-plant">How to plant&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You need to space each plant by 10 cm and row by 30 cm apart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Planting will happen in October on average, but it can happen from mid-September to the end of December. However, the earlier, the better the crops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The steps to plant are quite easy:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Take the best bulbs from the year before, &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/supermarket-garlic-for-seed-charles-dowding/">try to start from one organic bulb in your local supermarket&lt;/a>, preferably organic.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use a wood stick to make a 2-3 cm hole.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sow each clove the same way they were growing in the bulb.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cover over and you are done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="when-to-harvest">When to harvest&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the UK, the harvest time around the end of June.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my area, in Ardèche, it seems to be the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When to harvest garlic has nothing to do with how yellow the leaves are. At least half the leaves should still be green &lt;strong>unless a severe case of rust has attacked the plants&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What you want to feel around the bulb are the protrusions (e.g., where the cloves are forming). This is when the garlic is mature. You can feel this by uncovering the top of the garlic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you leave the garlic too long, you will get the following:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Take the garlic out by pulling it gently while digging it out gently to keep the stem and / or the remaining leaves. Keeping the stem will help conserving it longer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cut the roots while fresh.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Peel out the first outer skin because it is a lot easier&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-store-garlic">How to store garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At first, right after harvest, you can leave quite a bite of stem to help the garlic finish ripening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t leave garlic under the direct sun too long. Two days is enough to dry the outer skin, otherwise, it can start deteriorating. Then, put it under cover to dry some more for about 20 days, with enough air.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to judge the readiness of garlic, by Charles Dowding</title><link>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-judge-the-readiness-of-garlic-charles-dowding/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-judge-the-readiness-of-garlic-charles-dowding/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-09-22-how-to-judge-the-readiness-of-garlic-charles-dowding-hero.jpg" alt="Featured image of post How to judge the readiness of garlic, by Charles Dowding" />&lt;p>Credits: &lt;a href="https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/fr/view-image.php?image=206292&amp;amp;picture=germination-ail">George Hodan on publicdomainpictures.net&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once &lt;a href="https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-judge-the-readiness-of-garlic-charles-dowding/">you checked the garlic head is ready&lt;/a>, you should not leave it too long in the soil.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>the outer skin can decay and the garlic turns bad or the garlic may rot&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the cloves can start sprouting and you will see a lot of new garlic shoots&lt;/li>

&lt;p>It is a rampant fungal disease that infects the entire Allium family, including garlic and onions. If left unchecked, the disease can result in smaller-than-usual bulbs and limited growth of a plant. Garlic infected by rust is still edible and unless the infection was severe, you should get a decently sized bulb at harvest time. There’s no need to prematurely pick your garlic crop unless the entire plant is brown and dead. (Like “dead dead”, not “ready and ripe” dead.)&lt;/p>
