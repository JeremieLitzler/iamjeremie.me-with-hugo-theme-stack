Charles shares an example in this vlog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veHKCN73tUc">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A guy contacted him about using fresh manure as a great way to grow potatoes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So Charles decided to try also.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-take-out-of-using-fresh-horse-manure">The take out of using fresh horse manure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>He sees a lot of weeds growing, in addition to the nice vegetables. I had the same experience where common purslane grew a lot after applying fresh manure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the great news, it’s easy to remove those weeds from the hay.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tells us how efficient a proper composting process, e.g., getting the temperatures up, is to kill weed seeds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You need to add regularly material onto the heap and in the proper proportion of green and brown, e.g., in a 50/50 ratio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in fresh manure, vegetables can grow. But so the weeds in the hay ;)&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
