I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards&amp;rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asVqiG3f66M">this YouTube link&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even if the most common way to harvest garlic is to wait that the bottom has turned brown, there are two other types of garlic harvest:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Early harvest: when you harvest earlier, the garlic is much juicer and has a better flavor exchange in cooking.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Green garlic: you can then enjoy garlic up twelve weeks before the usual harvest time&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The latter will be the focus of the following notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before moving on, remember that late May is within that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Gap">hungry gap&lt;/a> period: it is the time of the year when you are finishing your winter crops, but the spring crops haven&amp;rsquo;t yet yielded fruits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the hungry gap, alongside with green garlic, you can find purple broccoli and asparagus to fill the leanest period of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-green-garlic">What is green garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is similar to a leak.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You won&amp;rsquo;t only eat the immature bulb but you will also eat the stem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="when-to-harvest">When to harvest&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It really is up to you. Huw&amp;rsquo;s preference is to pick it up when it is the size of a small leak.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="benefits-of-green-garlic">Benefits of green garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you forget to sow garlic in the autumn, you can still sow it in the spring and get green garlic, even if you may not get a mature garlic (it is actually harder to &amp;ldquo;bulb-up&amp;rdquo; garlic when planted in spring).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another benefit is to set free garden space for another crop, like shallots. Then you don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait all the way to the end of June / early July to set the new crop.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cooking-and-green-garlic">Cooking and green garlic&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Green garlic is more like a leak, in flavor, but sweeter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, green garlic with potatoes gives an interesting taste, because of the sweetness of garlic when young.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-idea-with-closer-spacing">Growing idea with closer spacing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>What about sowing the cloves closer, like every 5 cm instead of every 10 cm, so that, when the green garlic harvest comes, you harvest every other one to leave the other one to grow fully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then in the same space, you will get both green and mature garlic.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
