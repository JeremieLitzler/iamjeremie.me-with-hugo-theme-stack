[{"content":"I’m using the Hugo theme stack from Jimmy Cai.\nIt already includes in the head template the code to add a canonical link.\nBut, at one stage, I had to set a link from an article I published on a publishing platform.\nTherefore, I couldn’t let the theme generate a canonical link automatically.\nThe goal I wanted to keep the automation for articles first published on my blog.\nThen, in some cases, I wanted to republish an article on my blog while it was already available on the Internet.\nWhy In SEO, the best practices are:\nEach webpage must have a canonical link. A single webpage with the same content must be published once and only once in the Internet. If you break those two rules, then the web crawlers won’t index your pages and you will miss out on some traffic.\nSolution using the Hugo theme stack First I had to find where the canonical link was generated. I found it in layouts/partials/head/head.html:\n1 \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;canonical\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Now, how could I specify within the frontmatter of a given article that I wanted the canonical link to be a specific one?\nWith a little search, I’ve found this thread on the Hugo forum.\nThe frontmatter data is accessible through .Params that contains key/value pairs.\nThe key is the name of the frontmatter property.\nIn my case, I named the canonical relcanonical and the value had to be a string.\nIt gives you the following:\n1 2 3 --- relcanonical: https://iamjeremie.me --- The head.html line above had to change to the following:\n1 2 3 4 5 {{ with .Params.relcanonical }} \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;canonical\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;{{ . | relLangURL }}\u0026#34; itemprop=\u0026#34;url\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; {{ else -}} \u0026lt;link rel=\u0026#34;canonical\u0026#34; href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34; itemprop=\u0026#34;url\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; {{ end -}} In the above code,\nWhen the relcanonical is set ({{ with .Params.relcanonical }}) Use its value, which is the . in {{ . }}.

It’s important to follow that usage so the code works. And if you don’t, ESLint will make sure to tell when writing in TypeScript.\nAnd when you need to set a prop as non-required (implicitly, they’re required…), use the ? following the prop name:\n1 const props = defineProps\u0026lt;{ id?: string }\u0026gt;(); Now, it will get more complex when you need to set defaults.\nBefore, using JavaScript and the Option API, you would write:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 props: { id: { type: String, default: null } } Or if you prefer the Composition API, it would look this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 const { id } = defineProps({ id: { type: String, default: null, }, }); Note: you can destructure the props easily with { propName } as shown above.\nUsing TypeScript and the composition API, you will need to use withDefaults macro and create an interface to define the props:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 interface ThreadEditorPageProps { title?: string; body?: string; } const props = withDefaults(defineProps\u0026lt;ThreadEditorPageProps\u0026gt;(), { title: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, body: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, }); So let’s break down the code:\ntitle and body are string props and they’re optional. then (1) instantiate the props by providing to the withDefaults macro the defineProps macro typed with the interface and (2) add an object with all the props you need to define a default value for. In the example, not providing a default value would mean the props would both equal to undefined because of the ?.\nWith explicit defaults, they will equal to an empty string.\nYou don’t have to define a default for all props and they don’t need to be flagged as optional to receive a default value.\nFinally, when I recommend to use the interface declaration when you have many props and extract this interface to a separate file that you will simply import in your component. To me, that makes the component’s code cleaner.\nDo you have questions on the topic?

And the above code shows that a distinct copy of the value gretting is created to initialize newGreeting.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t have a link in any way between the two variables.\nReference types When you create an object, it’s stored in memory and the JavaScript uses a reference or its address in memory to find the value.\nThat reference is used to handling the object.\nFor example:\n1 2 3 4 const greeting = { message: \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; }; let newGreeting = gretting; newGreeting.message = \u0026#34;Bonjour\u0026#34;; The last assignment changes the value of the property gretting.message because both variable share the same refence in memory!\nTo avoid that, you must create a true copy of greeting. That can easily be done with the spread operator (given a flat object only, nested objects require more code\u0026hellip;):\n1 2 3 4 const greeting = { message: \u0026#34;Hello\u0026#34; }; let newGreeting = { ...greeting }; newGreeting.message = \u0026#34;Bonjour\u0026#34;; With {...greeting}, we assign a new object and therefore the JavaScript engine creates a new reference to store newGreeting.\nConsequently, newGreeting.message = 'Bonjour'; won’t affect the value of greeting.message.\n","date":"2024-03-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2024-03/variable-types-in-javascript/images/2024-03-06-list-of-variable-types_hu2aa14698dac678a8e2185ef9ead0193e_174830_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2024-03/variable-types-in-javascript/","title":"Differences between variable types in JavaScript"},{"content":"If you are building a medium-sized application, you will end up using navigation guards to browse the different pages of your application.\nThe basic use case is when you want to check an element exists before loading its details (for example on beforeEnter).\nNow, if you are building the application with Vue 3 and Pinia, you will do this by querying a store.\nHowever, the application doesn’t load Pinia until the mount call and you load the router before that…\nTherefore, Pinia will throw an error “getActivePinia()” was called but there was no active Pinia.

Create the app service The architecture of the WordPress app service on Microsoft Azure is the following:\nCredit: image from this article on Microsoft Learn.\nWhat we will focus the most on will be the App Service and the Azure Database for MySQL flexible server.\nI will mention the Storage account but I won’t go into the details.\nSo, from the Portal,\nYou select Create a resource I followed the Microsoft guide on WordPress migration and here are the steps summarized into 5 steps: Tip\nUse the official Microsoft App Service option.\nThe importants steps here are:\ncreating a new Resource group to organize the resources created, for example with the RG_Websites_Ressources. selecting the initial App Service plan size, starting from free. NB: if you perform a migration, the initial WordPress credentials account isn’t important since you will override it in later stages.\nFree tier may be too small for WordPress...\nIn my case...\nI unchecked everything, unlike it’s shown in the screenshot.\nIf you need to create a storage account, you can do it separately.\nThis is not necessary right now.\nTagging\nI think it’s important to tag the resources that you’re about to create.\nThe creation takes a while. So take a break and come back 15–20 minutes.\nClean up the resources To view all the resources you’ve just created, go to Portal homepage and select Resource groupstile.\nThen, select the resource group you created earlier, for example RG_Websites_Ressources.\nWhen you create an app service using the template in the Azure marketplace, it creates a bit too many resources.\nI haven’t noted all the ones that I deleted so let me show you which you need to keep:\nOne storage account One app service per website One database instance per app service One virtual network If you happen to create several app services using the previous step method, you will end up with a lot of resources.\nPlus, you will have one App Service plan per creation, which may not be something you want. For example, on the project, we’re running 2 app services using a single App Service plan.\nIt’s easy to create a new app service from an existing one.\nThe only distinct resources you need is an app service and a MySQL server instance (and even that one you could share between app services but I haven’t run into that scenario).\nSize the resources correctly The good news is that you can resize the app service and / or the MySQL server after creation. And all it takes is just a few clicks.\nIn my case, I had 2 websites and one was significantly larger than the other.\nTo modify the size of the app service, simply:\nBrowse to the app service resource. Select the Scale up (app service Plan) blade. Select the desired size. Confirm by clicking the Select button. To modify the MySQL server resource:\nBrowse to the resource. Select the Compute + storageblade. Select the Compute tier: either Burstable, General Purpose or Business Critical. Select the Compute size. Adjust the Storage size (minimum of 20 GiB is useful more than enough). Adjust the backup settings if needed confirm by clicking the Save button Configure the app service with HTTP/2 With WordPress, themes and plugins can generate quite a lot of requests on each page load. HTTP/2 leverage technology to optimize that and ditch the bundling strategy we have used with HTTP/1.1 servers.\nMicrosoft announced HTTP/2 support in this article on March 27, 2018.\nTo enable it, here are the steps:\nGo to the app service Select Configuration blade and then the General Settings tab Scroll down to find the HTTP/2 setting and set it to 2.0. Save and restart the app service. You can also find the raw configuration of the app service in the Azure Resource Explorer, but it’s more sensitive to edit over there.\nYou need to go under subscriptions \u0026gt; Microsoft Azure Sponsorship \u0026gt; resourceGroup \u0026gt; RG-YourOrg-Websites \u0026gt; providers \u0026gt; Microsoft.Web \u0026gt; sites \u0026gt; YourWebsiteName (aka name of the app service).\nMigrate from the shared hosting to Microsoft Azure This was the main task.\nWhile I started to perform the migration using the manual method for greater flexibility, I had to go back to the plugin method.\nWhy?\nThe Advanced Custom Fields plugin wasn’t working after performing the manual steps. It was a no-go since the existing website used it heavily.\nAfter a few attempts to find the cause, I finally migrated the website using the All-In-One WP Migration plugin.\nThe steps were pretty simple and nothing is missing in the guide.\nAs for the post’s migration actions, what Microsoft lists is pretty much what I did:\nSearch and replace (paths and domains) using Better Replace plugin to use the temporary domain (for ex.: mywebsite.azurewebsites.net).\nConfigure the custom domain once we had checked that all the functionalities worked and the pages all used the temporary domain. To configure your site with a custom domain follow the steps described in the guide “Map existing custom DNS name”.\nYou will need access the DNS Zone edition for that step ⬆️\nUpdate SSL certificates: once Microsoft Azure serves the domain, it’s as simple as going to the Custom domainsblade in the app service and add the binding to be SNI SSL. This requires that you configure your registar to point the target domain to Microsoft Azure.\nCost: for non-profits, take advantage of Microsoft’s sponsorship If you’re a non-profit organization, you can benefit from a Sponsorship from Microsoft.\nAt the time of writing, it’s $2000 per year!\nFor that amount, you can easily host a large website. In the case I dealt with, we have:\ntwo MySQL servers, the first at $62.33 per month (large website with more than 6000 pages and posts and a good steady traffic with a spike on Saturdays). the second at $10.21 per month (small website for now), an app service Plan (Premium v2 P1V2) at $75.92 per month, which is enough to run 2 app services. a storage account with 772 GB of Blob storage and 6 GB of File storage (yes, the organization serves a lot of audio, video and PDF files). Learn more at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/nonprofits/azure.\nMaintenance and updates with deployment slots Even if I was tempted to use a plugin for that, I didn’t.\nIn the following paragraphs, I detail the steps I took to use deployment slots.\nWhy deployment slots Once you completed migrating the website, it’s time to think about how to perform the maintenance. That includes updating the core of WordPress, the theme and the plugins.\nWhile you could use a plugin, such as UpdrafPlus or something else, I recommend using the deployment slots, native of Microsoft Azure, and they’re free of charge.\nI agree with you: it’s more technical, but the app service plan available to you includes it.\nPlus, I personally tried UpdrafPlus on Microsoft Azure and it didn’t go as well as I’d have hoped (random locking the database if the MySQL wasn’t big enough).\nI have shared below a full procedure used for months by this former client in the US. And it works great!\nAbout backups in Microsoft Azure Before we dive into the procedure itself, let’s talk about the backups.\nBy default, your database instance and app service are back up automatically.\nThe database is backed up once a day, around one hour after its creation. You can take manual backup at any time, within the limit of 50 per instance.\nAbout that limit\nWhen you create a new instance (which is the case when you perform maintenance), the counter starts from 0 again.\nSo you will never run out 😁\nThe app service is backed up every hour. You could set up manual backups but I don’t see a use for it. Plus, it requires to setup a storage account (additional costs) and to hook it up to the app service.\nNo doing a manual backup of the app service means the synchronization between the database and the app service may be out a bit.\nTo avoid loss of data, I recommend taking a manual backup of the database right after an automatic backup of the app service (this is a step in the procedure).\nAlso refrain from making modifications (apart from the updates to perform) before completing the maintenance tasks.\nUse the deployment slots When you have an app service running, you need to go to the Deployment slotsblade.\nOnce in the dashboard, you can create a slot from Add Slot:\nYou will need to:\nEnter the name of the slot. Below, I share how I name it. Select the parent app service to clone the settings from. Confirm by clicking Add. After a few seconds, the deployment slots dashboard is updated:\nUntil January 2024\nYou had to add the virtual network to the slot, as it wasn’t copied.\nMicrosoft seems to have resolved that! Hurray 🎆\nNext steps I have created for the organization I worked for a Google Sheet checklist which you can copy and use.\nIf you find an issue or a step that is obsolete, let me know.\nI recommend going through this procedure monthly or bimonthly. It takes less than one hour after you became familiar with it.\nConclusion I started from scratch, without any experience on Microsoft Azure. Still, I picked up rather quickly and I applied skills I had to organize the resources properly and lead the project to completion.\nI didn’t do everything but I asked questions about what I didn’t do. The son of the head of the organization pushed to use Microsoft Azure as he’s currently a Principal Cloud Engineer, specialized in cost optimization on Microsoft Azure.\nHe helped settings up the CDN to serve the audio, video and PDF content. He also helped to set up the dedicated Office 365 account used as the account sending emails from the website. Using the plugin WPO365 | MICROSOFT 365 GRAPH MAILER, we connected the forms to the Office 365 account to send the messages.\nMicrosoft Azure can be intimidated with the vast possibilities it provides. It’s a complex ecosystem. Yet, it’s a valuable skill to have and I’m glad I acquired it.\n","date":"2024-02-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2024-02/how-to-migrate-wordpress-site-to-ms-azure/images/wordpress-app-service-diagram_hu3ab7efb706468219c54a44979d10b083_87483_120x120_fill_box_smart1_3.png","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2024-02/how-to-migrate-wordpress-site-to-ms-azure/","title":"How to migrate a WordPress site to Microsoft Azure"},{"content":"I find this trick very handy once you have set it up.\nIn JavaScript projects Add the alias to jsconfig.json to have intellisense super powers and the advatange of absolute paths:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 { \u0026#34;compilerOptions\u0026#34;: { ... \u0026#34;paths\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@/*\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;./src/*\u0026#34;] } ... } In TypeScript projects Install the package: @types/node as dev dependency.

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding\u0026rsquo;s channel.\nYou can watch it using these YouTube links:\nSeptember 7, 2018. September 12, 2019. In 2018, it marks the first-year anniversary of the experiment to make a 25 m² garden, similar to Damien Dekarz in France.\nWeather and harvest Now, in September, the weather is warm in the Zone 8A where Charles lives and they had some rain in August, which was welcome after the previous 3 months that required watering every second or third day.\nThe runner beans, Czar variety, needed that water especially.\nAt this time of the year, many vegetables are getting ready or are ready:\ncarrots sown in mid-June, leaks sown in early April and planted in June to replace the spinach Pest control Charles has been using for years a thin white mesh to protect the carrots, the cabbages and the Swede, particularly in summer. But in September, it starts to be easier for those vegetables.\nAlso, he sprays some bacillus thuringiensis (soil bacteria) that he finds on Ebay as dry powder. He sprays it every 18 days (depending on the weather of course). It makes the leafy greens uneatable to caterpillars. If they try, they die\u0026hellip;\nIs that safe for humans?\nIt seems that it is fine. UV rays destroy the bacteria after a while, hence the repeat spray.\nWhen it comes to using this insecticide, use the powder form, not the GMO form that some labs have integrated to seeds\u0026hellip;\nAccording to this article on \u0026ldquo;MedecinesSciences.org\u0026rdquo;, it could cause an immune response in the digestion track.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t successful tried cabbages yet, as the slugs have usually eaten them before they were tall enough to become attractive to caterpillars.\nCharles seems to be confident it doesn\u0026rsquo;t affect mammals. I\u0026rsquo;d be interested in an alternative. For example, what feeds on caterpillars?\nAccording to AZ Animals, the following animals are the most common predators of caterpillars:\nBirds Humans Lacewings Paper wasps Yellow jackets Ladybird beetles Ladybugs Spiders (some species) New sowing During September, it is time to harvest the summer crops and replace them with the next crops like fennel, land cress or spinach.\nPersonal note\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to try spinach for the first time this month.\nI have prepared an area of my garden with compost.\nSoon, we are going to get some good rain and with the warm temperatures, I\u0026rsquo;m sure they will grow and may be ready for harvest in October.\nHopefully, the badgers won\u0026rsquo;t till the soil as they love to do\u0026hellip;\nThe advantage of spinach sown now is that it will crop up in the autumn and will survive the winter to crop again in the spring. Is that not awesome?\nCharles sowed spinach early August and planted them 4 weeks later. I\u0026rsquo;m going to sow direct. It may not work if the snails and slugs attack the young plants. However, from the past year observation, the compost seemed to repel them so we will see.\nCharles doesn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to fill all the gaps he finds with crops that will do well at this time in that utumn and winter.\nHarvest for seeds Leaving some crops bolt or go to seed, like French beans, will provide free seeds for next year\u0026rsquo;s sowing.\nA garden is not just vegetables Planting flowers will benefit the garden because good insects will flock to them, especially the cosmos.\nHow crop can you harvest in 25 m² By September, Charles claims to have harvested 120 kg of vegetables!

Covey\nBODY ⇒ MIND ⇒ HEART ⇒ SPIRIT\nHow do I perceive my attitude?\nThere are no shortcuts in life. You take one, you’ll get short-term success, but probably you’ll reap long-term issues…\nWhat we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we can say or do.\n~ Stephen R. Covey\nWhat are my maps about “ways things are” (realities) and “ways things should be” (values)?\nHow many young women do you see? And how many old women?\nAt page 39, the paradigm shift is interesting to look at in the occasion that I feel that my children are loud:\nA man and his children came into the subway, the kids were very loud and annoying the other passengers. The father didn’t seem to care.\nStephen R. Covey came to him and asked that he controlled them so they annoy the fellow passengers. The man just witnessed his wife die an hour ago.\nThink about this paradigm: is it worth screaming and getting angry after children when they annoy you? Certainly not.\nSee the quote of Thoreau:\n“For every thousand hacking at the leaves of evil, there is one striking at the root”\nAs Stephen said:\nWe can only achieve quantum improvements in our lives as we are hacking at the leaves of attitude and behavior and get to work on the root, the paradigms at which our attitudes and behaviors flow.\nPrinciples They are the following:\nfairness integrity honesty service quality/excellence human dignity patience nurturance encouragement There is a process to go through from A to B.\nNo shortcuts possible. I know what I’m talking about: in my software engineering, when we skip a step just to save time or to deliver faster, we pay more afterwards.\nSame goes about your relationships.\nAlso, to grow, we must take the steps in the right direction.\nInterpersonal relationships mean to listen. And to listen, you need emotional strength.\nLook at the drawing again:\nSo what are the 7 habits?\nThey enable you to move:\nfirst, from dependence to independence second, independence to interdependence I think I am too focused on independence. When I read pages 57 and 58, I see that I can continue to try on my own to improve, but I will not feel satisfied nor efficient.\nI need help: interdependence is to continue to grow with others.\nToo much independence is often a sign of dependence in reality.\nYou could compare this to harvesting a crop after you plant it instead of the contrary, which is obviously impossible.\nEffectiveness defined It’s a balance of P/PC.\nP stands for Production.\nPC stands for Production Capabilities.\nIf one is missing, it cannot work.\nFor example, in the book, Dr. Covey tells the story of the goose producing the golden eggs. The farmer kills it when he becomes greedy that he cannot wait until the next day to get the golden egg. He thought that by “opening the goose”, he would get more golden egg. But in the final analysis, he would get none, for the rest of his life.\nWe find 3 kinds of assets in the P/PC principle:\nPhysical Financial Human A balanced P/PC occurs when the assets are preserved, but not only.\nSimilarly, asset balance is key to success and effectiveness.\nWhat does it mean? If you have too much physical assets over human assets, what would happen for a married couple had too many golden eggs but no relationship?\nAnother example: you could buy a tool made with wooden handles that helps you aerate the soil in the garden. You use it often because it does its job very well. But neglect to store it by leaving it outside. Weeks after weeks and the rain falls, the wood of the handle begins to rot and eventually, during a use, the handles break and you left with nothing to take care of the garden. You will need to buy a new handle while taking a few seconds at each use would have prevented this from happening.\nIn this case, we focused too much on the soil being aerated (P) and not on the care of the tool (PC).\nSee on pages 63 to 64 the last four paragraphs that show that neglecting the goose (PC) for the golden eggs (P) in a couple or in a parent/child relationship will sicken the goose day by day and eventually, it will die.\nLet me quote two paragraphs:\nAnd what about a parent’s relationship with a child? When children are little, they are very dependent, very vulnerable. It becomes so easy to neglect the PC work—the training, the communicating, the relating, the listening. It’s easy to take advantage, to manipulate, to get what you want the way you want it-right now! You’re bigger, you’re smarter and you’re right! So why not just tell them what to do? If necessary, yell at them, intimidate them, insist on your way.\nOr you can indulge the. You can go for the golden eggs of popularity, of pleasing them, giving them their way all the time. Then they grow up without any internal sense of standards or expectations, without a personal commitment to being disciplined or responsible.\nIn summary, care for the goose—the quality of the relationship—and it will be fed well and it will be healthy.\n","date":"2023-09-04T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-09/7-habits-intro-inside-out/images/_hu680c0e61cd7d0d81ae102c01235489eb_40804_0d225b6607203c23cacba3dbe97772de.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-09/7-habits-intro-inside-out/","title":"7 Habits from Stephen Covey - Inside Out"},{"content":"In August, the garden may feel like a jungle. And yet, gaps may start to appear. Let’s see what Huw suggests to fill them out.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nDefault “setting”: spread compost Huw suggests that the default “setting” is to cover the empty area with compost.\nWhy?\nBecause a healthy soil is key to success in the garden.\nA healthy soil consists of minerals, organic matter and also all of the microbes such as bacteria and fungi.\nAnd one way to promote a healthy soil is by using methods such as the No Dig method.\nI’ve been using this method for 3 years now. At first, I was experimenting to find the materials.\nIn fact, with the No Dig method, you want to apply light layers of mulch of compost of around two to three centimeters.\nBut how do you find that compost?\nIf you were a commercial gardener like Charles Dowding, you could make you own. But most of us aren’t.\nSo this year, I’ve found how to find a large amount of compost: in France, it seems that places, where you can buy sand, gravels and other stony products, you can also buy organic compost in bulk.\nFor me, it’s a place nearby (10 min drive) and the ton of compost costs 48 euros.\nThe weight-to-volume ratio is 1 kilogram = 2 liters. So for 1000 liters or 1 meter cube, I need to buy 500 kg.\nCompost can be used as a protective layer for the soil.\nYou have a choice then. Either:\nyou plant some crops that will be ready late fall, e.g., radish, lettuce, turnips and spinach, at least in zone 8 climate. For more details, you can watch this vlog from Liz Zorab. you let the land rest by applying some cardboard weighted down. In the latter case, it will be ready in the spring and it will be free of weeds.\nTry out things Huw says:\nOne of the most enjoyable parts of growing food is when you push against the norm and against common wisdom and try something different, and when you get pleasantly surprised that something new, that isn’t really recommended, actually turns out well for you, then that’s a huge sense of joy and excitement.\nTo me, this is the fact that I tried kiwaï vine, that produces small fruits rich in vitamin C.\nIt’s found in my garden for 3 years now.\nWe planted a second vine this winter because the first one is so productive.\nAfter a false start on the first year (we had severe frost in April 2021), last year saw a successful harvest of a bit of fruits.\nThis year, it will be even better.\nI haven’t heard about kiwaï before I tasted it in a local farmer market near our home.\nThen I found it in the gardening store and purchased it.\nIt’s easy to plant and rather small at the beginning. Yet, it will grow taller than you.\nIt likes to climb a regular fence meshes with 10 cm squares.\nAnother test I did, which is now not a test but a regular thing we do in our garden, is the No Dig method.\nWhy did I pick it up? Because I can spend energy digging in the garden. I can’t buy the petrol-powered tools to till the soil either.\nSo No Dig made perfect sense.\nAlso, Huw gives the example of planting broad beans in August just to try and see what happens.\nFor example, did you know you can eat the top of the plant as shoots? I didn’t!\nNature can surprise you. It can bounce back sometimes.\n","date":"2023-08-31T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-08/what-should-a-gardener-do-in-august/images/2023-08-31-harvested-onions_hu6a696e63eaefdbf6b01e094b4ddc3510_538676_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-08/what-should-a-gardener-do-in-august/","title":"What should a gardener do in August"},{"content":"I have used VuePress for a year.

Clean up the occurrences if you have any.\n2- Copy the content of .vuepress/public into the folder content/static Also, if you are using something like Drawio and that you use the export to HTML feature, you will need to add what follows at the top of each exported HTML file:\n1 2 +++ +++ This allows the website to compile (see https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/solved-using-html-for-content-pages-instead-of-markdown/3374/5).\n3- Rename all the README.md to index.md, if you used to name the root file Hugo requires the markdown files in a directory to be named index.md when you use the following folder structure.\n1 2 3 4 5 content/ |__ post/ |__ my-article/ |__ index.md |__ images/ I saw tutorials where people named them something-else.md, but it is when you use this other folder structure:\n1 2 3 content/ |__ post/ |__ my-article.md I prefer the former because I keep the images specific to a post in the same place as the markdown file.\nThe script below has to be run into the content directory to convert the README.md files to index.md.\n1 find . -iname \u0026#39;README.md\u0026#39; -execdir mv {} index.md \\; 4- Pick a theme I tried the theme suggested by Hugo’s starter guide, but it was way too dull and I couldn’t get the list page to work.\nThen I have found Jimmy’s Stack theme: https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack-starter.\nIt is rich, works and is documented!\nWith this theme, I was missing the fenced blocks I use on the VuePress them for notes, tips, warnings and dangers messages.\n5- Update on the theme To be honest, at first, with Hugo-recommended theme, I was a bit confused about how Hugo works.\nThen, using Jimmy’s theme made everything click.\nMy goal was to keep the natural relative links between the different files (relative links) and use the VuePress syntax provided in the Mr Hope theme somehow.\nRelative links Out of the box, Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide the ability to render a relative markdown link like this one:\n1 [My link to another page within the site](../page/about.md) to this link in HTML:\n1 \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://mydomain.com/page/about/\u0026#34;\u0026gt;My link to another page within the site\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; While you could use the {{\u0026lt; ref \u0026quot;/path/to/page-or-post/\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode as the Hugo documentation tells you, it is not practical and lack intellisense within VSC for me to select the files.\nIf you want to show shortcode example in fenced code blocks like above...\nDo what Joe Mooring says in the GitHub issue.\nPlus, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out how to replace the hundreds of links in my websites from markdown native syntax to shortcode syntax\u0026hellip;\nThankfully, after a little bit of research, I found the template override of render-link.html that does exactly what I needed.\nSee here in my repository.\nYou have to put it under layouts/_default/_markup/render-link.html.\nAbout non index.md files\nHowever, for relative links to any file not named index.md, it will not work.\nI use this pattern for large pages:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 content/ |__ post/ |__ my-article/ |__ images/ |__ index.md |__ part-1.md |__ part-2.md |__ ... |__ part-N.md You need to either:\nPut the file into it own folder. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 content/ |__ post/ |__ my-article/ |__ images/ |__ index.md |__ part-1/ |__ index.md |__ part-2/ |__ index.md ... |__ part-N/ |__ index.md Merge the files together. Block containers Next, I wanted to use the equivalent syntax below with Hugo:\n1 2 3 4 5 :::warning My container title My container body ::: With the help of Lovirr and CaiJimmy, I found the solution: creating a custom shortcode. See my discussion with them on the topic.\nYou put it under layouts/shortcodes. In my case, I named it blockcontainer.html.\nThe content is available in my repository.\nYou can change the CSS class, if you want. My styles are the following:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 root { --theme-color: #3eaf7c; --accent-color: var(--theme-color); --body-text-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8); --notice-note-light: #fdfdfe; --notice-note-dark: #858585; --notice-tip-light: #e6f6e6; --notice-tip-dark: var(--theme-color); --notice-warn-light: #fff8e6; --notice-warn-dark: #e6a700; --notice-danger-light: #ffebec; --notice-danger-dark: #e13238; } :root[data-scheme=dark] { --body-text-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); --notice-note-light: #858585; --notice-note-dark: #fdfdfe; --notice-tip-light: var(--theme-color); --notice-tip-dark: #e6f6e6; --notice-warn-light: #e6a700; --notice-warn-dark: #fff8e6; --notice-danger-light: #e13238; --notice-danger-dark: #ffebec; } .jli-notice { padding: 0.5em; border-radius: 0.5em; margin: 1em 0; } .jli-notice .highlight, .jli-notice .gallery, .jli-notice blockquote { margin-left: initial; margin-right: initial; width: initial; } .jli-notice p { margin: 0; } .jli-notice-title { font-weight: bold; } .jli-notice-note { background-color: var(--notice-note-light); border: 1px solid var(--notice-note-dark); border-left: 4px solid var(--notice-note-dark); } .jli-notice-tip { background-color: var(--notice-tip-light); border: 1px solid var(--notice-tip-dark); border-left: 4px solid var(--notice-tip-dark); } .jli-notice-warning { background-color: var(--notice-warn-light); border: 1px solid var(--notice-warn-dark); border-left: 4px solid var(--notice-warn-dark); } .jli-notice-danger { background-color: var(--notice-danger-light); border: 1px solid var(--notice-danger-dark); border-left: 4px solid var(--notice-danger-dark); } Next, I created this Visual Studio Code snippet to use it very easily when I write content.\nIn the markdown file, it looks like that:\n1 2 3 4 5 {{\u0026lt; blockcontainer jli-notice-warning \u0026#34;My container title\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} My container body {{\u0026lt; /blockcontainer \u0026gt;}} To be clear, in the above example,\njli-notice-warning is CSS class added to the div block. It is referenced by $noticeType in the HTML definition of the shortcode. My container title is the title that the shortcode renders in the first p element My container body is the body or content of the shortcode. It can be any valid multiline markdown content. See $raw in the HTML definition of the shortcode. As you see shortcodes works like an HTML element, with an opening and closing tag.\nYou could use the opening syntax only:\n1 {{\u0026lt; blockcontainer jli-notice-warning \u0026#34;Just a title\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} You can use regular Markdown for images and links in the body.\nFor relative links to other pages or posts within a same site, be careful not to use the following markdown content when inside the blockcontainer.\nFor example, with the following structure under content directory:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 content/ |__ post/ |__ an-awesome-post |__ index.md |__ my-first-post |__ index.md You can write the following markdown :\n1 2 3 4 5 {{\u0026lt; blockcontainer jli-notice-warning \u0026#34;My container title\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} [My awesome post](../an-awesome-post/index.md) {{\u0026lt; /blockcontainer \u0026gt;}} While the link would work outside the shortcode, it won’t inside… I haven’t figured out why.\nHowever, I figured out how to make it work within the shortcode. You must use an absolute reference:\n1 2 3 4 5 {{\u0026lt; blockcontainer jli-notice-warning \u0026#34;My container title\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} [My awesome post](/post/an-awesome-post/index.md) {{\u0026lt; /blockcontainer \u0026gt;}} 6- Update the frontmatter First, I used to have heroImage and heroAlt (alternative text of the heroImage).\nIn Hugo, heroImage is image and it works the same. The value image: /images/my-image.jpg means the image must go in static/images/.\nHowever, contrary to VuePress and the theme I used, this value works image: images/my-image.jpg (for a page, the image is in /page/images/my-image.jpg).\nImportant\nYou must add frontmatter to each markdown file. Otherwise, you see the article but no title to click to navigate to the page or post, even if you have # My title at the top\u0026hellip;\n7- Images in the markdown files You simply need to declare an image in the usual way:\n1 2 3 4 5 #when a folder “images” exists at the same level as the markdown file ![My image](images/my-image.jpg) # when the image is in “/static/images” ![My image](/images/my-image.jpg) Comparison of VuePress vs. Hugo Build performance ⇒ better on Hugo\nfor the same content, it takes half the time\ninstead of\nIn my team\u0026rsquo;s documentation site at work, the build time went from ~250 seconds to 5 seconds. Not bad ;)\nBlockcontainer ⇒ OK, using a custom shortcode.\nMetadata ⇒ OK, OpenGraph + canonical are generated out-of-the-box and use the frontmatter title, description and image.\nSEO ⇒ better, because I have control over all the pages, especially the categories and tags, even though I have to manually create them.\nSee the demo of the Hugo theme I\u0026rsquo;m using. You will quickly understand how it works. Image ⇒ I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. While the documentation says responsiveness is available out-of-the-box and webp is possible, I have yet to figure this out.\nI couldn\u0026rsquo;t compare with VuePress because LightHouse, PageSpeed.web.dev and GTMetrix tell me they can\u0026rsquo;t analyze the VuePress article I wanted to compare\u0026hellip; Category and tag taxonomy ⇒ better, URL is normalized and page is customizable :)\nIn-line markdown links to other posts or pages ⇒ OK\nOne thing I needed to do: the organization of my content. While I used the following structure of my articles:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 docs/ |__ 2023/ |__ 08/ |__ my-article/ |__ index.md |__ images/ I move to this structure:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 content/ |__ post/ |__ 2023-08 |__ my-article/ |__ index.md |__ images/ I had to implement redirects from the old path to the new one.\nThis is achievable with netlify.toml file. See https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/\nFeel free to use this Google Sheet to build your redirects.\nUse this bash script to list all posts that you copy the Sheet:\n1 2 cd /docs find . -iname \u0026#39;README.md\u0026#39; As you finish reading this long, but I hope useful article, I wish an awesome journey with Hugo.\n","date":"2023-08-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-08/migrate-from-vuepress-to-hugo/images/2023-08-30-hugo-homepage_hu8d586a1c04cf51476b2b5069cfd56fc5_105475_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-08/migrate-from-vuepress-to-hugo/","title":"Migrate from Vuepress to Hugo"},{"content":"Huw is trying a new method with no garden plan to experiment and learn.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nSuccession planting This method is important to optimize the garden space and always have something growing in all available areas.\nFor example, Huw followed potatoes with leaks in this month of July.\nBouncing of leaks\nIf a leak looks a little bit sad after transplantation, it’s OK. Water them and they will recover shortly.\nHarvesting lettuces Similarly to Charles Dowding, Huw adopted the method to harvest lettuces by picking the outer leaves regularly, which helps to produce a lot more than cutting the salad.\nGrowing parsley under runner beans Parsley likes shade. What better idea than growing it under runner beans, that climb up high. At least, for Huw, it has been very successful.\nSquashes I agree with Huw about squashes: don’t plan them too packed because all varieties grow and spread a lot. I see that with my volunteer curry pumpkins, that I have been grown from the seeds. I throw in the compost pile the seeds after prepare a dish and, in the past four years, they have work awesomely well.\nThey always produce so much, in my opinion, especially when you know that I only water them during the summer and they produce from 12 to 17 kg of crops per year.\nInterestingly, I never get diseases with those volunteer squashes.\nNo Dig focus Huw’s garden was already 95% No Dig in 2021, at the time of the shooting of the vlog.\nUsing Charles Dowding No Dig, he will use organic matter to built up some strong and resilient soil life.\nI’ve been trying out the No Dig also for 3 years. The main challenge is to gather enough organic matter.\nMy most successful organic matter is cottonwood dead leaves. They’re small and abundant around my area and last winter, the girls and I picked up 12 trailers (700 liters of volume) and we have got a good amount left still. Worms have found their home in the leftover piles, which is awesome.\nI use them to cover the bed in winter (about 20 to 30 cm thick layer) and I add some to cover the irrigation pipes in the summer to protect them from the sun.\nPlug in gaps technique With a no garden plan, you prepare seedlings and fill the gaps in beds, finding a home for everyone.\nIntroduce more flowers to the garden Flowers attract pollinators in the garden.\nSo, as a message to my future self, grow more. The ladies in the household will appreciate it :)\nAt the moment, we have got comfrey, borages, Echinacea, one cosmos flower, self-sown from last year.\nTo keep the cosmos flowers flowering, remove the dead flowers.\nGrowing onions Huw never grows onions from seeds. It takes too much effort.\nI tried to grow some this year, but they didn’t do well, at least not as great as the garlic.\nMore diversity of sweet peas Just like Huw, I love sweet peas. They taste just awesome, right off the plant, no need to cook them.\nThis year, we harvested seeds from pods we let grow big and hopefully, we’ll plant them next year.\nIt’s amazing to harvest your own seed, making your garden resilient as you enter the cycle of self-sufficiency.\nI’d love to find those pink and purple sweet peas that Huw grows. Mine are only white.\nYou like this article, consider subscribing to the newsletter and you will receive up to two articles each week, on Mondays and Thursdays.\n","date":"2023-07-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-07/vegetable-garden-tour-in-july-huw-richards/images/2023-07-24-aerial-view-of-huw-s-garden_huff3023fba784fb7c16f04867ad5a3e2d_238951_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-07/vegetable-garden-tour-in-july-huw-richards/","title":"Vegetable Garden Tour in July, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"I am developping a custom search API from VuePress static websites and I needed to host it.\nSince I have a Cloudways VPS, let\u0026rsquo;s see how to run the REST API.\nWhat do you need Create an account on Cloudways.

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nA lot of second planting happened already.\nIn the first row And some crops are finishing like Lilla onions, that can’t be stored unfortunately.\nLeaks were planted a month ago, to take over from spinach.\nJust after that, beetroots followed the harvest of early potatoes.\nIn the second row In place of the early lettuces (which gave out many kilograms of food), carrots were sown.\nCharles recommends\nTo harvest lettuce, Charles picks only the outer leaves so that the lettuce keep on producing and it helps the lettuce not to bolt.\nThe above lettuces were sown on the 1st of July and planted the 24th of July.\nIn the same row, Charles planted kale, the Cavolo Nero kind. They will crop up in the fall and maybe even through the winter.\nThe kale replaced the early carrots, that gave out 4 kg of crops on mid-July.\nTo finish the row, Charles planted French beans, following the radishes and garlic as first crops.\nCharles planted French beans in between the garlic and radishes, always optimizing the space.\nRabbit protection\nRabbits love young leaves and Charles uses a winter mesh to protect the crops.\nIn the third row More carrots, that replaced early beetroot, were sown.\nPeas for shoots were replaced by Swedes (Gowrie kind).\nAbout Swede and insects\nThe Swedes require a mesh one to prevent the summer insects to infest the crops.\nIf you don’t, the Swedes will fork and they won’t taste as good.\nNext, Charles planted some summer crops, like:\npeppers aubergines\ndwarf ground cherry (Physalis)\nregular tomatoes cherry tomatoes\nTomatoes were planted in between spinach a few months back, always using the space when it’s available.\nAt the end of summer, Charles will draw lines between the tomatoes to grow the next spinach, always having something to grow.\nConclusion The takeaway is that you can:\nuse the space when available, plan to sow and plant using a plan.

Moreno walks us through his garden to show us the different gardening tasks to perform this month.\nThanks to Moreno for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on The Dutch Farmer’s channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nHarvest of garlic It usually happens early on the month of July.\nPersonal note\nThis year 2023 was my first year to grow garlic and with over 100 cloves planted, we are happy with the green garlic we enjoy in May and June and the dry garlic we’ll enjoy the rest of the summer.\nMoreno is quite happy with the multi-crop beds. Remember, he talked about it in his March episode.\nHe shares an interesting fact about soft neck garlic: it can store up to 12 months! The hard neck garlic usually doesn’t store longer than 6 months.\nOnce you harvested the garlic, you will need to cure them, e.g., clean them for storage.\nIt is important to remember that to dry them, you shouldn’t set them in direct sunlight, yet they need to be hanging in a ventilated, warm and dry place. It will take 4 to 6 weeks to dry.\nFruit trees Trees provide many benefits:\nextra food shade for the crops under them help preventing bolting on the spring crops It can become more difficult, however, to have fruit trees above market gardening crops, adding more labor to harvest them.\nSo plant your vegetable beds well to make it easier.\nTomatoes You can see above that Moreno uses as much as possible the available space, planting lettuces or flowers at the bottom of tomatoes or cucumbers.\nIn market gardening, tomatoes have a highly profitable value, even though the work you need to perform more important.\nWhen you harvest them, it is important to harvest them not fully ripe; otherwise it will shorten the time you have to sell them.\nEven though you harvest them not fully ripe, they continue to ripen.\nAll this applies to large tomatoes. In fact, the cherry and cocktail types are better harvested fully ripe because they sell more easily.\nConclusion July is the month when harvesting is the focus and it is when you will make most of the year’s revenue.\nStill, soon, it will be time to prepare for the fall and winter crops.\n","date":"2023-07-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-07/market-gardening-in-july-the-dutch-farmer/images/2023-07-03-bumblebees-on-echinacea-flowers_hua23a59e52d4e5d8de31e5eec4d3cffee_122575_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-07/market-gardening-in-july-the-dutch-farmer/","title":"Market Gardening in July, by The Dutch Farmer"},{"content":"The following article is a copy of https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-consume-and-document-a-rest-api/, an article written by Germán Cocca.\nI used it to learn the basis of API development with NodeJS.\nI particularly like the folder structure and empahasis on the architecture.\nWhy a copy?\nThe original article doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide a table of contents accessible on the side like my blog.\nHi everyone! In this tutorial we\u0026rsquo;re going to take a deep dive into REST APIs.\nI recently wrote this article where I explained the main differences between common API types nowadays. And this tutorial aims to show you an example of how you can fully implement a REST API.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll cover basic setup and architecture with Node and Express, unit testing with Supertest, seeing how we can consume the API from a React front-end app and finally documenting the API using tools such as Swagger.\nKeep in mind we won\u0026rsquo;t go too deep into how each technology works. The goal here is to give you a general overview of how a REST API works, how its pieces interact, and what a full implementation might consist of.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go!\nWhat is REST? Representational State Transfer (REST) is a widely used architectural style for building web services and APIs.\nRESTful APIs are designed to be simple, scalable, and flexible. They are often used in web and mobile applications, as well as in Internet of Things (IoT) and microservices architectures.\n**Main Characteristics:**\n**Stateless:** REST APIs are stateless, which means that each request contains all the necessary information to process it. This makes it easier to scale the API and improves performance by reducing the need to store and manage session data on the server. **Resource-based:** REST APIs are resource-based, which means that each resource is identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) and can be accessed using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. **Uniform Interface:** REST APIs have a uniform interface that allows clients to interact with resources using a standardized set of methods and response formats. This makes it easier for developers to build and maintain APIs, and for clients to consume them. **Cacheable:** REST APIs are cacheable, which means that responses can be cached to improve performance and reduce network traffic. **Layered System:** REST APIs are designed to be layered, which means that intermediaries such as proxies and gateways can be added between the client and server without affecting the overall system. **Pros of REST APIs**:****\n**Easy to learn and use:** REST APIs are relatively simple and easy to learn compared to other APIs. **Scalability:** The stateless nature of REST APIs makes them highly scalable and efficient. **Flexibility:** REST APIs are flexible and can be used to build a wide range of applications and systems. **Wide support:** REST APIs are widely supported by development tools and frameworks, making it easy to integrate them into existing systems. **Cons of REST APIs**:****\n**Lack of standards:** The lack of strict standards for REST APIs can lead to inconsistencies and interoperability issues. **Limited functionality:** REST APIs are designed to handle simple requests and responses and may not be suitable for more complex use cases. **Security concerns:** REST APIs can be vulnerable to security attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) if not implemented properly. REST APIs are best for:****\nREST APIs are well-suited for building web and mobile applications, as well as microservices architectures and IoT systems. They are particularly useful in situations where scalability and flexibility are important, and where developers need to integrate with existing systems and technologies. In summary, REST APIs are a popular and widely used architectural style for building web services and APIs. They are simple, scalable, and flexible, and can be used to build a wide range of applications and systems.\nWhile there are some limitations and concerns with REST APIs, they remain a popular and effective option for building APIs in many different industries and sectors.\nHow to Build a REST API with Node and Express Our tools Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 and has since become a popular choice for building web applications, APIs, and servers.\nNode.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, allowing it to handle large amounts of data with high performance. It also has a large and active community, with many libraries and modules available to help developers build their applications more quickly and easily.\nExpress.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, which is used to build web applications and APIs. It provides a set of features and tools for building web servers, handling HTTP requests and responses, routing requests to specific handlers, handling middleware, and much more.\nExpress is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and scalability, making it a popular choice for developers building web applications with Node.js.\nSome of the key features and benefits of Express.js include:\nMinimalistic and flexible: Express.js provides a minimalistic and flexible structure that allows developers to build applications the way they want to. Routing: Express.js makes it easy to define routes for handling HTTP requests and mapping them to specific functions or handlers. Middleware: Express.js allows developers to define middleware functions that can be used to handle common tasks such as authentication, logging, error handling, and more. Robust API: Express.js provides a robust API for handling HTTP requests and responses, allowing developers to build high-performance web applications. Our architecture For this project we\u0026rsquo;ll follow a layers architecture in our codebase. Layers architecture is about dividing concerns and responsibilities into different folders and files, and allowing direct communication only between certain folders and files.\nThe matter of how many layers should your project have, what names should each layer have, and what actions should it handle is all a matter of discussion. So let\u0026rsquo;s see what I think is a good approach for our example.\nOur application will have five different layers, which will be ordered in this way:\nApplication layers The application layer will have the basic setup of our server and the connection to our routes (the next layer). The routes layer will have the definition of all of our routes and the connection to the controllers (the next layer). The controllers layer will have the actual logic we want to perform in each of our endpoints and the connection to the model layer (the next layer, you get the idea\u0026hellip;) The model layer will hold the logic for interacting with our mock database. Finally, the persistence layer is where our database will be. An important thing to keep in mind is that in these kinds of architectures, **there\u0026rsquo;s a defined communication flow** between the layers that has to be followed for it to make sense.\nThis means that a request first has to go through the first layer, then the second, then the third and so on. No request should skip layers because that would mess with the logic of the architecture and the benefits of organization and modularity it gives us.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to know some other API architecture options, I recommend you this software architecture article I wrote a while ago.\nThe code for the API Before jumping to the code, let\u0026rsquo;s mention what we\u0026rsquo;ll actually build. We\u0026rsquo;ll be building an API for a pet shelter business. This pet shelter needs to register the pets that are staying in the shelter, and for that we\u0026rsquo;ll perform basic CRUD operations (create, read, update and delete).\nNow yeah, let\u0026rsquo;s get this thing going. Create a new directory, hop on to it and start a new Node project by running npm init -y.\nThen install Express by running npm i express and install nodemon as a dev dependency by running npm i -D nodemon (Nodemon is a tool we\u0026rsquo;ll use to get our server running and test it). Lastly, also run npm i cors, which we\u0026rsquo;ll use to be able to test our server locally.\nApp.js Cool, now create an app.js file and drop this code in it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 import express from \u0026#34;express\u0026#34;; import cors from \u0026#34;cors\u0026#34;; import petRoutes from \u0026#34;./pets/routes/pets.routes.js\u0026#34;; const app = express(); const port = 3000; /* Global middlewares */ app.use(cors()); app.use(express.json()); /* Routes */ app.use(\u0026#34;/pets\u0026#34;, petRoutes); /* Server setup */ if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;) { app.listen(port, () =\u0026gt; console.log(`⚡️[server]: Server is running at https://localhost:${port}`) ); } export default app; This would be the application layer of our project.\nHere we\u0026rsquo;re basically setting up our server and declaring that any request that hits the /pets direction should use the routes (endpoints) we have declared in the ./pets/routes/pets.routes.js directory.\nNext, go ahead and create this folder structure in your project:\nRoutes Hop on to the routes folder, create a file called pets.routes.js, and drop this code in it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 import express from \u0026#34;express\u0026#34;; import { listPets, getPet, editPet, addPet, deletePet, } from \u0026#34;../controllers/pets.controllers.js\u0026#34;; const router = express.Router(); router.get(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, listPets); router.get(\u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;, getPet); router.put(\u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;, editPet); router.post(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;, addPet); router.delete(\u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;, deletePet); export default router; In this file we\u0026rsquo;re initializing a router (the thing that processes our request and directs them accordingly given the endpoint URL) and setting up each of our endpoints.\nSee that for each endpoint we declare the corresponding HTTP method (get, put, and so on) and the corresponding function that that endpoint will trigger (listPets, getPet, and so on). Each function name is quite explicit so we can easily know what each endpoint does without needing to see further code. ;)\nLastly, we also declare which endpoint will receive URL parameters on the requests like this: router.get(\u0026quot;/:id\u0026quot;, getPet); Here we\u0026rsquo;re saying that we\u0026rsquo;ll receive the id of the pet as an URL parameter.\nControllers Now go to the controllers folder, create a pets.controllers.js file, and put this code in it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 import { getItem, listItems, editItem, addItem, deleteItem, } from \u0026#34;../models/pets.models.js\u0026#34;; export const getPet = (req, res) =\u0026gt; { try { const resp = getItem(parseInt(req.params.id)); res.status(200).json(resp); } catch (err) { res.status(500).send(err); } }; export const listPets = (req, res) =\u0026gt; { try { const resp = listItems(); res.status(200).json(resp); } catch (err) { res.status(500).send(err); } }; export const editPet = (req, res) =\u0026gt; { try { const resp = editItem(parseInt(req.params.id), req.body); res.status(200).json(resp); } catch (err) { res.status(500).send(err); } }; export const addPet = (req, res) =\u0026gt; { try { const resp = addItem(req.body); res.status(200).json(resp); } catch (err) { res.status(500).send(err); } }; export const deletePet = (req, res) =\u0026gt; { try { const resp = deleteItem(parseInt(req.params.id)); res.status(200).json(resp); } catch (err) { res.status(500).send(err); } }; Controllers are the functions that each endpoint request will trigger. As you can see, they receive as parameters the request and response objects. In the request object we can read things such as URL or body parameters, and we\u0026rsquo;ll use the response object to send our response after doing the corresponding computation.\nEach controller calls a specific function defined in our models.\nModels Now go to the models folder and create a pets.models.js file with this code in it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 import db from \u0026#34;../../db/db.js\u0026#34;; export const getItem = (id) =\u0026gt; { try { const pet = db?.pets?.filter((pet) =\u0026gt; pet?.id === id)[0]; return pet; } catch (err) { console.log(\u0026#34;Error\u0026#34;, err); } }; export const listItems = () =\u0026gt; { try { return db?.pets; } catch (err) { console.log(\u0026#34;Error\u0026#34;, err); } }; export const editItem = (id, data) =\u0026gt; { try { const index = db.pets.findIndex((pet) =\u0026gt; pet.id === id); if (index === -1) throw new Error(\u0026#34;Pet not found\u0026#34;); else { db.pets[index] = data; return db.pets[index]; } } catch (err) { console.log(\u0026#34;Error\u0026#34;, err); } }; export const addItem = (data) =\u0026gt; { try { const newPet = { id: db.pets.length + 1, ...data }; db.pets.push(newPet); return newPet; } catch (err) { console.log(\u0026#34;Error\u0026#34;, err); } }; export const deleteItem = (id) =\u0026gt; { try { // delete item from db const index = db.pets.findIndex((pet) =\u0026gt; pet.id === id); if (index === -1) throw new Error(\u0026#34;Pet not found\u0026#34;); else { db.pets.splice(index, 1); return db.pets; } } catch (error) {} }; These are the functions responsible for interacting with our data layer (database) and returning the corresponding information to our controllers.\nDatabase We wont use a real database for this example. Instead we\u0026rsquo;ll just use a simple array that will work just fine for example purposes, though our data will of course reset every time our server does.\nIn the root of our project, create a db folder and a db.js file with this code in it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 const db = { pets: [ { id: 1, name: \u0026#34;Rex\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;dog\u0026#34;, age: 3, breed: \u0026#34;labrador\u0026#34;, }, { id: 2, name: \u0026#34;Fido\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;dog\u0026#34;, age: 1, breed: \u0026#34;poodle\u0026#34;, }, { id: 3, name: \u0026#34;Mittens\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;, age: 2, breed: \u0026#34;tabby\u0026#34;, }, ], }; export default db; As you can see, our db object contains a pets property whose value is an array of objects, each object being a pet. For each pet, we store an id, name, type, age and breed.\nNow go to your terminal and run nodemon app.js. You should see this message confirming your server is alive: ⚡️[server]: Server is running at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000).\nHow to Test a REST API with Supertest Now that our server is up and running, let\u0026rsquo;s implement a simple test suit to check if each of our endpoints behaves as expected.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re not familiar with automated testing, I recommend you read this introductory article I wrote a while ago.\nOur tools to test SuperTest is a JavaScript library that is used for testing HTTP servers or web applications that make HTTP requests. It provides a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, allowing developers to send HTTP requests and make assertions about the responses received, making it easier to write automated tests for web applications.\nSuperTest works with any JavaScript testing framework, such as Mocha or Jest, and can be used with any HTTP server or web application framework, such as Express.\nSuperTest is built on top of the popular testing library Mocha, and uses the Chai assertion library to make assertions about the responses received. It provides an easy-to-use API for making HTTP requests, including support for authentication, headers, and request bodies.\nSuperTest also allows developers to test the entire request/response cycle, including middleware and error handling, making it a powerful tool for testing web applications.\nOverall, SuperTest is a valuable tool for developers who want to write automated tests for their web applications. It helps ensure that their applications are functioning correctly and that any changes they make to the codebase do not introduce new bugs or issues.\nThe code to test First we\u0026rsquo;ll need to install some dependencies. To save up terminal commands, go to your package.json file and replace your devDependencies section with this. Then run npm install\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \u0026#34;devDependencies\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;@babel/core\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^7.21.4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;@babel/preset-env\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^7.21.4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;babel-jest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^29.5.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;jest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^29.5.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;jest-babel\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^1.0.1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;nodemon\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^2.0.22\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;supertest\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;^6.3.3\u0026#34; } Here we\u0026rsquo;re installing the supertest and jest libraries, which we need for our tests to run, plus some babel stuff we need for our project to correctly identify which files are test files.\nStill in your package.json, add this script:\n1 2 3 \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;jest\u0026#34; }, To end with the boilerplate, in the root of your project, create a babel.config.cjs file and drop this code in it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 //babel.config.cjs module.exports = { presets: [ [ \u0026#34;@babel/preset-env\u0026#34;, { targets: { node: \u0026#34;current\u0026#34;, }, }, ], ], }; Now let\u0026rsquo;s write some actual tests! Within your routes folder, create a pets.test.js file with this code in it:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 import supertest from \u0026#34;supertest\u0026#34;; // Import supertest import server from \u0026#34;../../app\u0026#34;; // Import the server object const requestWithSupertest = supertest(server); // We will use this function to mock HTTP requests describe(\u0026#39;GET \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { test(\u0026#39;GET \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; returns all pets\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { const res = await requestWithSupertest.get(\u0026#34;/pets\u0026#34;); expect(res.status).toEqual(200); expect(res.type).toEqual(expect.stringContaining(\u0026#34;json\u0026#34;)); expect(res.body).toEqual([ { id: 1, name: \u0026#34;Rex\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;dog\u0026#34;, age: 3, breed: \u0026#34;labrador\u0026#34;, }, { id: 2, name: \u0026#34;Fido\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;dog\u0026#34;, age: 1, breed: \u0026#34;poodle\u0026#34;, }, { id: 3, name: \u0026#34;Mittens\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;, age: 2, breed: \u0026#34;tabby\u0026#34;, }, ]); }); }); describe(\u0026#39;GET \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { test(\u0026#39;GET \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; returns given pet\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { const res = await requestWithSupertest.get(\u0026#34;/pets/1\u0026#34;); expect(res.status).toEqual(200); expect(res.type).toEqual(expect.stringContaining(\u0026#34;json\u0026#34;)); expect(res.body).toEqual({ id: 1, name: \u0026#34;Rex\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;dog\u0026#34;, age: 3, breed: \u0026#34;labrador\u0026#34;, }); }); }); describe(\u0026#39;PUT \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { test(\u0026#39;PUT \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; updates pet and returns it\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { const res = await requestWithSupertest.put(\u0026#34;/pets/1\u0026#34;).send({ id: 1, name: \u0026#34;Rexo\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;dogo\u0026#34;, age: 4, breed: \u0026#34;doberman\u0026#34;, }); expect(res.status).toEqual(200); expect(res.type).toEqual(expect.stringContaining(\u0026#34;json\u0026#34;)); expect(res.body).toEqual({ id: 1, name: \u0026#34;Rexo\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;dogo\u0026#34;, age: 4, breed: \u0026#34;doberman\u0026#34;, }); }); }); describe(\u0026#39;POST \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { test(\u0026#39;POST \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; adds new pet and returns the added item\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { const res = await requestWithSupertest.post(\u0026#34;/pets\u0026#34;).send({ name: \u0026#34;Salame\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;, age: 6, breed: \u0026#34;pinky\u0026#34;, }); expect(res.status).toEqual(200); expect(res.type).toEqual(expect.stringContaining(\u0026#34;json\u0026#34;)); expect(res.body).toEqual({ id: 4, name: \u0026#34;Salame\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;, age: 6, breed: \u0026#34;pinky\u0026#34;, }); }); }); describe(\u0026#39;DELETE \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34;\u0026#39;, () =\u0026gt; { test(\u0026#39;DELETE \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; deletes given pet and returns updated list\u0026#39;, async () =\u0026gt; { const res = await requestWithSupertest.delete(\u0026#34;/pets/2\u0026#34;); expect(res.status).toEqual(200); expect(res.type).toEqual(expect.stringContaining(\u0026#34;json\u0026#34;)); expect(res.body).toEqual([ { id: 1, name: \u0026#34;Rexo\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;dogo\u0026#34;, age: 4, breed: \u0026#34;doberman\u0026#34;, }, { id: 3, name: \u0026#34;Mittens\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;, age: 2, breed: \u0026#34;tabby\u0026#34;, }, { id: 4, name: \u0026#34;Salame\u0026#34;, type: \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;, age: 6, breed: \u0026#34;pinky\u0026#34;, }, ]); }); }); For each endpoint, the tests send HTTP requests and check the responses for three things: the HTTP status code, the response type (which should be JSON), and the response body (which should match the expected JSON format).\nThe first test sends a GET request to the /pets endpoint and expects the API to return an array of pets in JSON format. The second test sends a GET request to the /pets/:id endpoint and expects the API to return the pet with the specified ID in JSON format. The third test sends a PUT request to the /pets/:id endpoint and expects the API to update the pet with the specified ID and return the updated pet in JSON format. The fourth test sends a POST request to the /pets endpoint and expects the API to add a new pet and return the added pet in JSON format. Finally, the fifth test sends a DELETE request to the /pets/:id endpoint and expects the API to remove the pet with the specified ID and return the updated list of pets in JSON format. Each test checks whether the expected HTTP status code, response type, and response body are returned. If any of these expectations are not met, the test fails and provides an error message.\nThese tests are important for ensuring that the API is working correctly and consistently across different HTTP requests and endpoints. The tests can be run automatically, which makes it easy to detect any issues or regressions in the API\u0026rsquo;s functionality.\nNow go to your terminal, run npm test, and you should see all your tests passing:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 \u0026gt; restapi@1.0.0 test \u0026gt; jest PASS pets/routes/pets.test.js GET \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; ✓ GET \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; returns all pets (25 ms) GET \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; ✓ GET \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; returns given pet (4 ms) PUT \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; ✓ PUT \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; updates pet and returns it (15 ms) POST \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; ✓ POST \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; adds new pet and returns the added item (3 ms) DELETE \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; ✓ DELETE \u0026#34;/:id\u0026#34; deletes given pet and returns updated list (3 ms) Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total Tests: 5 passed, 5 total Snapshots: 0 total Time: 1.611 s Ran all test suites. How to Consume a REST API on a Front-end React App Now we know our server is running and our endpoints are behaving as expected. Let\u0026rsquo;s see some more realistic example of how our API might be consumed by a front end app.\nFor this example, we\u0026rsquo;ll use a React application, and two different tools to send and process our requests: the Fetch API and the Axios library.\nOur frontend tools React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update and render them in response to changes in application state.\nThe Fetch API is a modern browser API that allows developers to make asynchronous HTTP requests from client-side JavaScript code. It provides a simple interface for fetching resources across the network, and supports a variety of request and response types.\nAxios is a popular HTTP client library for JavaScript. It provides a simple and intuitive API for making HTTP requests, and supports a wide range of features, including request and response interception, automatic transforms for request and response data, and the ability to cancel requests. It can be used both in the browser and on the server, and is often used in conjunction with React applications.\nThe frontend code Let\u0026rsquo;s create our React app by running yarn create vite and following the terminal prompts. Once that\u0026rsquo;s done, run yarn add axios and yarn add react-router-dom (which we\u0026rsquo;ll use to setup basic routing in our app).\nApp.jsx Put this code within your App.jsx file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 import { Suspense, lazy, useState } from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from \u0026#34;react-router-dom\u0026#34;; import \u0026#34;./App.css\u0026#34;; const PetList = lazy(() =\u0026gt; import(\u0026#34;./pages/PetList\u0026#34;)); const PetDetail = lazy(() =\u0026gt; import(\u0026#34;./pages/PetDetail\u0026#34;)); const EditPet = lazy(() =\u0026gt; import(\u0026#34;./pages/EditPet\u0026#34;)); const AddPet = lazy(() =\u0026gt; import(\u0026#34;./pages/AddPet\u0026#34;)); function App() { const [petToEdit, setPetToEdit] = useState(null); return ( \u0026lt;div className=\u0026#34;App\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Router\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Pet shelter\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Link to=\u0026#34;/add\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button\u0026gt;Add new pet\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Link\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Routes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/\u0026#34; element={ \u0026lt;Suspense fallback={\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/\u0026gt;}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PetList /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Suspense\u0026gt; } /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/:petId\u0026#34; element={ \u0026lt;Suspense fallback={\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/\u0026gt;}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;PetDetail setPetToEdit={setPetToEdit} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Suspense\u0026gt; } /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/:petId/edit\u0026#34; element={ \u0026lt;Suspense fallback={\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/\u0026gt;}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;EditPet petToEdit={petToEdit} /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Suspense\u0026gt; } /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Route path=\u0026#34;/add\u0026#34; element={ \u0026lt;Suspense fallback={\u0026lt;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/\u0026gt;}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;AddPet /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Suspense\u0026gt; } /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Routes\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Router\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } export default App; Here we\u0026rsquo;re just defining our routes.

One to add a new pet to the list. Besides, we have a button to add a new pet and a state that will store the information of the pet we want to edit.\nNext, create a pages directory with these files in it:\nPetList.jsx Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the file responsible for rendering the whole list of pets:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 import { useEffect, useState } from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; import { Link } from \u0026#34;react-router-dom\u0026#34;; import axios from \u0026#34;axios\u0026#34;; function PetList() { const [pets, setPets] = useState([]); const getPets = async () =\u0026gt; { try { /* FETCH */ // const response = await fetch(\u0026#39;http://localhost:3000/pets\u0026#39;) // const data = await response.json() // if (response.status === 200) setPets(data) /* AXIOS */ const response = await axios.get(\u0026#34;http://localhost:3000/pets\u0026#34;); if (response.status === 200) setPets(response.data); } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, error); } }; useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { getPets(); }, []); return ( \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Pet List\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {pets?.map((pet) =\u0026gt; { return ( \u0026lt;div key={pet?.id}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; {pet?.name} - {pet?.type} - {pet?.breed} \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Link to={`/${pet?.id}`}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button\u0026gt;Pet detail\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Link\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); })} \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; ); } export default PetList; As you can see, logic-wise we have 3 main things here:\nA state that stores the list of pets to render. A function that executes the corresponding request to our API. A useEffect that executes that function when the component renders. You can see that the syntax for making the HTTP request with fetch and Axios is rather similar, but Axios is a tiny bit more succinct. Once we make the request, we check if the status is 200 (meaning it was successful), and store the response in our state.\nOnce our state is updated, the component will render the data provided by our API.\nRemember that to make calls to our server, we must have it up and running by running nodemon app.js in our server project terminal.\nPetDetail.jsx Now let\u0026rsquo;s go to the PetDetail.jsx file:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 import { useEffect, useState } from \u0026#34;react\u0026#34;; import { useParams, Link } from \u0026#34;react-router-dom\u0026#34;; import axios from \u0026#34;axios\u0026#34;; function PetDetail({ setPetToEdit }) { const [pet, setPet] = useState([]); const { petId } = useParams(); const getPet = async () =\u0026gt; { try { /* FETCH */ // const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/pets/${petId}`) // const data = await response.json() // if (response.status === 200) { // setPet(data) // setPetToEdit(data) // } /* AXIOS */ const response = await axios.get(`http://localhost:3000/pets/${petId}`); if (response.status === 200) { setPet(response.data); setPetToEdit(response.data); } } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, error); } }; useEffect(() =\u0026gt; { getPet(); }, []); const deletePet = async () =\u0026gt; { try { /* FETCH */ // const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/pets/${petId}`, { // method: \u0026#39;DELETE\u0026#39; // }) /* AXIOS */ const response = await axios.delete( `http://localhost:3000/pets/${petId}` ); if (response.status === 200) window.location.href = \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;; } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, error); } }; return ( \u0026lt;div style={{ display: \u0026#34;flex\u0026#34;, flexDirection: \u0026#34;column\u0026#34;, justifyContent: \u0026#34;center\u0026#34;, aligniItems: \u0026#34;center\u0026#34;, }} \u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Pet Detail\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {pet \u0026amp;\u0026amp; ( \u0026lt;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Pet name: {pet.name}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Pet type: {pet.type}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Pet age: {pet.age}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Pet breed: {pet.breed}\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div style={{ display: \u0026#34;flex\u0026#34;, justifyContent: \u0026#34;center\u0026#34;, aligniItems: \u0026#34;center\u0026#34;, }} \u0026gt; \u0026lt;Link to={`/${pet?.id}/edit`}\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button style={{ marginRight: 10 }}\u0026gt;Edit pet\u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/Link\u0026gt; \u0026lt;button style={{ marginLeft: 10 }} onClick={() =\u0026gt; deletePet()}\u0026gt; Delete pet \u0026lt;/button\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/\u0026gt; )} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; ); } export default PetDetail; Here we have two different kind of requests:\nOne that gets the information of the given pet (which behaves very similar to the previous request we saw).

We\u0026rsquo;re using all of our API endpoints in our front end app. =)\nHow to Document a REST API with Swagger Now that we have our server up and running, tested, and connected to our front end app, the last step in our implementation will be to document our API.\nDocumenting and API generally means declaring which endpoints are available, what actions are performed by each endpoint, and the parameters and return values for each of them.\nThis is useful not only to remember how our server works, but also for people who want to interact with our API.\nFor example, in companies it\u0026rsquo;s very usual to have back-end teams and front-end teams. When an API is being developed and needs to be integrated with a front-end app, it would be very tedious to ask which endpoint does what, and what parameters should be passed. If you have all that info in a singe place, you can just go there and read it yourself. That\u0026rsquo;s what documentation is.\nOur tools for Swagger Swagger is a set of open-source tools that help developers build, document, and consume RESTful web services. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface for users to interact with an API and also generates client code for various programming languages to make API integration easier.\nSwagger provides a comprehensive set of features for API development, including API design, documentation, testing, and code generation. It allows developers to define API endpoints, input parameters, expected output, and authentication requirements in a standardized way using the OpenAPI specification.\nSwagger UI is a popular tool that renders OpenAPI specifications as an interactive API documentation that allows developers to explore and test APIs through a web browser. It provides a user-friendly interface that allows developers to easily view and interact with API endpoints.\nHow to Implement Swagger Back in our server app, to implement Swagger we\u0026rsquo;ll need two new dependencies. So run npm i swagger-jsdoc and npm i swagger-ui-express.\nNext, modify the app.js file to look like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 import express from \u0026#34;express\u0026#34;; import cors from \u0026#34;cors\u0026#34;; import swaggerUI from \u0026#34;swagger-ui-express\u0026#34;; import swaggerJSdoc from \u0026#34;swagger-jsdoc\u0026#34;; import petRoutes from \u0026#34;./pets/routes/pets.routes.js\u0026#34;; const app = express(); const port = 3000; // swagger definition const swaggerSpec = { definition: { openapi: \u0026#34;3.0.0\u0026#34;, info: { title: \u0026#34;Pets API\u0026#34;, version: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34;, }, servers: [ { url: `http://localhost:${port}`, }, ], }, apis: [\u0026#34;./pets/routes/*.js\u0026#34;], }; /* Global middlewares */ app.use(cors()); app.use(express.json()); app.use( \u0026#34;/api-docs\u0026#34;, swaggerUI.serve, swaggerUI.setup(swaggerJSdoc(swaggerSpec)) ); /* Routes */ app.use(\u0026#34;/pets\u0026#34;, petRoutes); /* Server setup */ if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== \u0026#34;test\u0026#34;) { app.listen(port, () =\u0026gt; console.log(`⚡️[server]: Server is running at https://localhost:${port}`) ); } export default app; As you can see, we\u0026rsquo;re importing the new dependencies, we\u0026rsquo;re creating a swaggerSpec object that contains config options for our implementation, and then setting a middleware to render our documentation in the /api-docs directory of our app.\nBy now, if you open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/api-docs/ you should see this:\nThe cool thing about Swagger is it provides an out-of-the-box UI for our docs, and you can easily access it in the URL path declared in the config.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s write some actual documentation!\nHop on to the pets.routes.js file and replace its code with this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 import express from \u0026#34;express\u0026#34;;

export default router; As you can see, we\u0026rsquo;re adding a special kind of comment for each of our endpoints. This is the way Swagger UI identifies the documentation within our code. We\u0026rsquo;ve put them in this file since it makes sense to have the docs as close to the endpoints as possible, but you could place them wherever you want.\nIf we analyze the comments in detail you could see they\u0026rsquo;re written in a YAML like syntax, and for each of them we specify the endpoint route, HTTP method, a description, the parameters it receives and the possible responses.\nAll comments are more or less the same except the first one. In that one we\u0026rsquo;re defining a \u0026ldquo;schema\u0026rdquo; which is like a typing to a kind of object we can later on reuse in other comments. In our case, we\u0026rsquo;re defining the \u0026ldquo;Pet\u0026rdquo; schema which we then use for the put and post endpoints.\nIf you enter http://localhost:3000/api-docs/ again, you should now see this:\nEach of the endpoints can be expanded, like this:\nAnd if we click the \u0026ldquo;Try it out\u0026rdquo; button, we can execute an HTTP request and see what the response looks like:\nThis is really useful for developers in general and people who want to work with our API, and very easy to set up as you can see.\nHaving an out-of-the-box UI simplifies the interaction with the documentation. And having it within our codebase as well is a great bonus, as we can modify and update it without the need of touching anything else but our own code.\nWrapping Up As always, I hope you enjoyed the handbook and learned something new.

Let’s look at what Huw is recommending to do this month.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nTomatoes First, clean up the weeds at the bottom of the bottom of the plants\nSecond, remove the suckers, which are those stems coming out which will make your plant huge, but that will draw energy out of producing tomatoes. It’s especially true in cooler climates.\nCutting everything (suckers and leaves) below the first trust or the first flowers will go a long way to keep the plant healthy.\nPlus, clearing the base will increase airflow to prevent blite.\nFinally, clear out the older leaves.\nSee how Huw does it from 2:28 in the vlog.\nRain and watering Gathering rain water, even in the UK for Huw, has become an issue. The vlog dates back to 2020! So imagine today…\nWith dry weather, keeping up with watering is hard…\nPlus, some vegetables will tend to bolt, meaning they will go to seed.\nWith less water, you can also clean up the dead leaves to make sure diseases don’t spread and so that the garden looks tidy.\nMore sowing You can still see at this time of the year.\nWhat can you sow? Personal note\nIt will depend on your climate, your region. Even if you can find templates here and there, the real method is to use the guidelines of people around your area with experience and ask them.\nThen, because everyone has a unique garden, it’s through observation that you will know:\nbased on the experience, year after year. based on the understanding of the weather. based on the nature of your soil. When do you sow Prefer sowing when it’s cooler, especially during this month of summer.\nCrops progress and harvesting Again, through observation, you will need to check on your crops, checking for diseases, readiness for harvest and need of watering.\nFor example, potatoes coming to flower are ready to harvest.\nHuw usually waits a couple of weeks when he sees the flower buds of the plants.\nAnother tip\nWhen you water lettuce, wait it from the top like shown below.\nThe water will then sink through the middle and it will give the full benefits to the lettuce.\nLess weeding Why?\nThe crops are growing and they leave little space to competing weeds.\nPersonal note\nThat isn’t the case for everything, of course. For example, bindweed can climb a crop and get its sunlight to continue to grow…\nPlan for the next planting Some crops will soon stop producing and it’s a good idea to the prepare the seedlings to plant whenever you will free garden space.\nThat’s it for this vlog.\n","date":"2023-06-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-06/what-tasks-to-focus-on-in-june-huw-richards/images/2023-06-22-huw-s-garden-in-june_hu7c5912117bbbe99d450f310a81d8a3e9_207183_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-06/what-tasks-to-focus-on-in-june-huw-richards/","title":"What tasks to focus on in June, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"Let’s look at the steps to set it up so you can provide contents in two languages.\nWhen it comes to creating your newsletter, you have a wide choice of solutions.\nI chose Substack because of their values: putting the writers first and provide efficient tools to help them grow their subscriber base.\nHowever, when you speak 2 languages fluently, it isn’t straight forward how you can maintain a newsletter in each language in a single publication.\nYou could use two distinct publications, but I had written quite a few posts when I realized I needed to tidy up my publication regarding the dual-language content.\nPlus, some parts of the publication can’t be translated anyways.\nEnglish must be the default language As of today, you can’t set up all the texts in your preferred language.\nThe following will be in English, so pick the values carefully:\nthe Publication name, the Short description (it could include both languages, but it’s limited to 258 characters…), the Categories, the Square logo, the Cover photo, that is displayed on the welcome page, the Site design, which is simply the main color, the layout and font steps, the Publication details, with your name, copyright and mailing address.

Let’s look at how to optimize each task.\nThanks to Moreno for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on The Dutch Farmer’s channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nHarvesting lettuce The harvest of lettuce is simple, yet, you can perform it in such a way that will help enrich the soil.\nLike Moreno, I cut my lettuce at the ground level. This lets the root to rot in the soil, providing food for the soil’s web.\nThe important part to remember, though: cut low enough to prevent a new sprouting of the lettuce.\nMoreno cuts all the lettuces he needs at once before performing a first basic cleaning of the bottom of each lettuce from the damaged and wilted leaves.\nAs usual, in market gardening, keep track of:\nwhat you harvested, where you harvested the crops from the date, the quantity Use a garden journal\nMoreno shares some details about the journals that he keeps up with.\nIt allows you to record all the important information from the farm.\nFor example, in addition to the information above, it’s a good idea to record:\nthe number of days to maturity of crops depending on the period of the year the time to perform certain tasks The goal is to gather the information will help make the market gardening more profitable.\nComing back to the lettuce, it’s important to lower the temperature of the salad to keep fresh longer.\nMoreno performs the task of using a cold-water bath, plunging the lettuce’s heads upside down in water for a couple of seconds.\nAt the same time, it helps clean up the dirt.\nSee the process at 2:30 in the vlog.\nLeaving the lettuces to drip out for a while is important after the washing\nEggplant and pepper support system Why do you need support for eggplants and peppers? In the fruits are big, the plant may not stay up because of the heavy load.\nMoreno uses wood stakes that he sets every 5 plants.\nThen, every 25 cm, as the plant grows, he sets 2 strings, in each side of the plant that will hold it over time.\nWeeding Who wants to weed? Not me.\nPersonal note\nJust yesterday, I spent 1h15 weeding. What Moreno shares here isn’t applicable to all situations.\nHowever, this year, I spent the time covering with a big amount of cardboard and woodchips the alleys of my garden and it has made a big difference so far.\nThere is still weeds coming out. But the roots are shallow and the weeds are really easy to pull up, especially the bindweed and couch grass.\nMoreno uses two methods:\na tick layer of compost, of about 10 cm, for the cultivated areas, a tick layer of woodchip, of about 5 cm, for the pathways. This method doesn’t remove all weeds nor does it prevent weeds to grow. But it reduces a lot of the amount of them, resulting in a much lower time consumption weeding out the garden.\nFor market gardening, the no-dig approach really brings its benefits to keep a clean and weed-free garden. It’s important when you need to spend time sowing, planting and harvesting rather than weeding.\nMoreno weeds his garden 4 times a year, usually when he replaces a harvested crop with the next crop to sow or plant.\nThe key to weed-free garden\nNever let weeds get established.\nIf a weed goes to seed, remove it and keep a good eye on that area to remove the new weeds from that area.\nAnother trick Moreno shares: for the edges, cover them with landscape fabric and a good 5 cm of woodchips.\nPersonal note\nOn my property, we have a lot of historical weeds:\ncouch grass bindweeds brambles Those are the most difficult weeds to get rid of.\nLike I said above, I’m trying to weed them out using the no-dig approach as well using cardboard (from Charles Dowding’s tips) and woodchips.\nIt will take a few years to reach a point where the weeds are manageable.\nSo far this year, the bindweed is what I see the most. The funny thing is that it runs its roots below the cardboard until it can get out.\nIt’s therefore very easy to pull them out, and a long string of root with it.\nI’ll keep on adding more cardboard and woodchips on top, which will build up a good soil structure and will kill the weeds.\nYou liked this article?

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on The Dutch Farmer’s channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nGrowing food is an invaluable skill I can’t agree more with the statement that Moreno made about growing food yourself.\nIt not only yields food for your family, but also, it teaches a better understanding of the environment around.\nStewardship\nthe conducting, supervising, or managing of something. Especially : the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one’s care.\nWebster dictionary\nWe’re stewards of this planet, meaning we should manage to the best of abilities so that it’s sustained. We therefore shouldn’t exploit it like we can see the powerful corporations act.\nAs we’re nearing summer, cherries will be ripened by the end of the month or early next month, as usual.\nAnd I have seen news articles talking about the farmers in Ardèche, France, not knowing how to fight off the pest (the drosophilia suzikki](https://www.agropomme.ca/Documentation_publique/DSUZUKII/2BiologieDsuzukii.pdf)) that destroys the ripe cherries, when left untreated.\nI mean, just for the sake of producing profit (which the poor growers aren’t receiving much of it), they will spray chemicals that are known to be dangerous for our health.\nI won’t make a case here about it in this article.

Let’s look at it.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.\nYou can watch the original vlogs using the following links:\n2 Methods of Comfrey Propagation Growing and Using Comfrey—Perfect Plant for Permaculture Vegetable Gardening How to Propagate Comfrey - 2 Great Methods What is comfrey Comfrey is a perennial herb that likes to grow in moist soil and in the shade.\nIt’s native from Europe and Asia and it was introduced into the USA in the 17th century, where it thrives today.\nIts tap root can sometimes reach 3 m in depth. The plant can grow as tall as 1.5 m and 2 m wide.\nIt’s known as a dynamic accumulator, meaning that it mines the minerals and nutrients from the ground and draws it into the leaves.\nThe root acts like a straw.\nThe leaves are therefore high in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium, which makes it a great liquid feed ingredient.\nUsage It’s really easy to grow. You can obtain up to 3 cuts per year to using in mulching, liquid feed, compost ingredients and even as a herbal tea.\nTo feed the soil, comfrey is really good.\nFor example, to make the liquid feed, you simply need to:\ncut some leaves and tear them up into a bucket. press down the plant and add water to cover the materials leave it to ferment for 3 to 4 weeks strain it dilute it with 1:10 ratio with water before applying it to the vegetables. You can mix the comfrey with stinging nettle, another mineral rich plant.\nAs a mulch, you will simply apply the raw leave at the bottom of the plant you want to give a boost of nutrients and minerals.\nPropagation The propagation is easy.\nPersonal note\nAt the end of last year, I had little comfrey plants growing near the main plants (very likely from seeds).\nI transplanted them in another location in my garden and they’re successfully growing since the spring began.\nThe other method is to dig out some mature plant and use the roots propagate.\nYou simply take the roots and cut them into 5 cm long pieces. Then Huw suggests to put them into medium modules to so that they can get started, and then you transplant them.\nI’m wondering if simply bearing the piece in the soil doesn’t just work as well.\nThe comfrey “bocking 14” variety is especially good at propagation from a small section of roots.\nThe best time to do this is late spring or early summer.\n","date":"2023-04-18T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/growing-and-using-comfrey-in-the-garden-huw-richards/images/2023-04-18-comfrey-plant_hua06be837d8f45a2005db8a26e9fd02a8_198008_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/growing-and-using-comfrey-in-the-garden-huw-richards/","title":"Growing and Using Comfrey In the garden, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"When you grow seedlings, good care of the plants is key. Using nettle, we can increase and reach success.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nWhat is FPJ FPJ stands for Fermented Plant Juice, obtained with brown sugar or vinegar.\nYou use the liquid from that. When we use plants, we want to extract the minerals from those plants.\nHow do you make FPJ The process is simple to produce FPJ:\nyou sizzle the target plant you add organic brown sugar you mix up and wait See below the detailed procedure.\nWhat are the benefits of FPJ The sugar will work as a solvent, extracting all the good stuff from the plant.\nIt’s even more important when you deal with a broad spectrum plant.\nA broad spectrum plant is a plant that contains the 14–16 minerals plants need to grow.\nThe stinging nettle has all of them and the fermentation extraction provide the exact proportion the plants need!\nWhat is the difference between the water method and the sugar method The rain water method works.\nThe main differences are:\nthe concentration level of minerals that is higher with the brown sugar method. consequently, the dilution will be more important: 500 to 1 instead of 10 to 1. the shelf life is very good and the smell absent. To compare to making compost, it takes up to 2 years to obtain compost and even more time so that the soil assimilates the nutrients from it to give as food to the plants.\nAnother advantage: you can apply the fermented juice directly and the plant assimilates within the minerals from it within hours.\nAlso, the making of FPJ takes very little time.\nBenefits of nettle in the context of sowing Apart from the broad spectrum, the nettle will provide the boost of nutrients that the seeds need to get started.\nJust like a baby needs very close care and attention in the first 2 years of his life, the seedling needs the same care and attention to become a productive and healthy crop.\nStep-by-step tutorial to make FPJ Tools You will need:\na 2-liter stainless bowl a couple of jars: one of 250 ml that will hold the juice, one of 1 liter to make the juice. a cotton clothe labels a scale a pair of scissors a pan a fennel a pair of gloves, because nettles sting! a sterilized rock that fits in the jar : it will hold the plant Optionally, read the book The regenerative grower’s guide to Garder Amendments by Nigel Palmer (available in France, in the UK and in the US).\nThe ingredients You will just need:\nbrown sugar the weed plant you want to extract juice from The procedure The scale of the current procedure\nThe following quantities apply for a 1-liter jar.\nCollect 125 gr of fresh stinging nettles. Pick them early in the morning\nDon’t water the nettles. Put the nettles in the bowl and sizzle them. Add the brown sugar in a ratio of 3 parts of nettles to 2 parts of sugar. So that equals to about 80–85 gr of brown sugar. Mix the two ingredients. Fill the jar to 80% capacity and top up with a small layer of brown sugar. Add the stone to help the fermentation process to kick-start by pushing down the plant down. Cover the jar with a piece of the cotton clothe. Label the jar so you know what is the recipe and when it was made. Place the jar in a storage place at room temperature and not in direct sunlight. After a few hours, a brown juice will start to appear at the bottom:\nLeaving it for a week before you strain the juice.\nTo strain the juice, don’t be tempted to squize it.\nSimply:\nSet the fennel and a clean cloth on top. Put the big jar upside-down on the fennel and let the juice strain naturally, even if you need to leave it overnight.\nLabel the jar and store the juice at room temperature.\nThe smell of the juice is going to be very nice.\nHow to use FPJ for seedlings You won’t need much, so you’d better get an eyedropper ;)\nTake another a jar of 500 ml and fill to half with rain water.\nAdd a few drops (for 250 ml at a ration 1:500, you will need 2 ml of juice, which about 70 drops) in the water and add the seeds from 20 min to 1 hour.\nThe time you leave the seeds in the water depends on the seed.\nRecord what you do and compare soaked seeds and not soaked seeds to compare\nOnce the seedlings are in the ground, you either:\ndrench them with water using the 1:5000 ratio foliar spray for the more delicate seedlings Either method should be applied in the morning.\nAgain, if you like those articles, let me know by subscribing to my free newsletter.\n","date":"2023-04-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/use-nettles-to-improve-seedling-success-huw-richards/images/2023-04-11-a-bowl-of-nettle-with-brown-sugar_hud4866f8c0ebc2332fc0d08bcb8dc27d3_152116_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/use-nettles-to-improve-seedling-success-huw-richards/","title":"Amazing Way to Use NETTLES to Improve Seedling Success, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"Yes, nettle is a weed. But do you know a lot of weeds that are 10 times more useful than dreadful?\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nHuw details 7 reasons to grow more nettle in your vegetable garden is a great idea.\nReason #1: It attracts aphids The nettle is great to house all the aphids that are around the crops you are growing.\nSo grow them close to the vegetables that aphids love.\nPersonal note\nBut I don’t like that!!!\nI harvest nettle to eat and I don’t want to eat them…\nI have found that soaking the nettle in water with vinegar helps to detach all the aphids off the nettle.\nUse a salad spinner to finish off the aphids that might hang on tight :)\nReason #2: A wild patch of nettle Why? To help feed the wildlife. Whom am I thinking about? Ladybugs, of course!\nLadybugs love aphids and aphids love nettle so ladybugs love nettles :)\nAlso, many butterflies love nettles as it’s their main source of food.\nSo grow a patch of nettle right away. Go find a patch into the wild and pull a few roots or a female nettle that has gone to seed.\nThe male and female flowers occur on separate plants. Both flower sexes are green with yellow stamens, but the male flowers often have a purplish tinge and the female flowers tend to droop much more than the male flowers point upward.\nHere is an example of female nettle:\nAnd now an example of male nettle:\nDig a shallow trench and set the roots just like that.\nWithin a few months, nettles will come out. Within a year, they will spread :)\nReason #3: It’s a superfood It contains:\na lot of vitamins (A, C, K, severable B type) a lot of minerals, like calcium, iron a lot of proteins: in 100 grams of dried nettle, you find up to 30 grams of proteins. Nettle sting! So wear thick gloves. But don\u0026#39;t worry: the sting isn’t toxic. It just hurt.\nOr check out the young Huw showcasing how to do it with bear hands in \u0026ldquo;How to Eat Nettles without getting Stung\u0026rdquo;.\nPersonal note\nCooking the nettle get rid of their sting.\nHowever, simply washing the nettle with cold water or drying them won’t.\nWhen you pick nettle, pick the first 3 levels of leaves, which are tender and less fibrous, especially regarding the stem.\nThe most nutritious part is the seeds. They contain vitamin E and essential fatty acids.\nA teaspoon per day will help quite a lot of your health.\nReason #4: It’s a bioindicator What a bioindicator? It’s what the presence of a wild plant in a certain area tells us about the soil.\nSo nettle indicates that the soil is rich and moist.\nSo wherever you see neetle, you’re very likely to be successful with your gardening.\nReason #5: It serves as a good green mulching Nettle is loaded with nitrogen and potassium. So cutting nettle in bulk, you can then take it and spread it over a bed to boost the soil with the nutrients it contains.\nApply it as a green mulch around the perennials’ base.\nReason #6: It works wonderfully as an ingredient for liquid feed The steps are simple:\ncut in pieces the nettles add them into a bucket (half full after pressing on them) add water to the top of the nettle set a log or a stone over it to make sure the nettles are under water leave for 2 weeks use the liquid feed with a ratios 1 to 10: one part liquid feed and nine parts water. Because nettle contains a high quantity of manganese and calcium, you can use them for plants lacking those nutrients.\nReason #7: It’s a great compost ingredient Of course, use young nettle if you don’t want them to grow in the compost. Or do you?\nNettle brings huge improvement to the garden. When you search nettle+garden on Google, you find 12M results!\nReason #8: It makes a great herbal infusion To do so, cut some fresh nettle, wash them and pour boiling water over it.\nPersonal note\nI always eat the boiled nettles after 15 min. That way, you waste nothing :)\nFor more tips from Huw on this bonus usage, check out the younger Huw explaining it in \u0026ldquo;How to make a Nutritious Tea from Nettles\u0026rdquo;.\nAs always, you find this content useful, consider subscribing to my free newsletter.\n","date":"2023-04-10T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/the-nettle-the-incredibly-useful-permaculture-plant-huw-richards/images/2023-04-10-close-up-on-a-female-nettle_hu65ce7b3c71850b56763dc33e5f3d834f_121945_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/the-nettle-the-incredibly-useful-permaculture-plant-huw-richards/","title":"The Nettle, An Incredibly Useful Permaculture Plant, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"April is a month when you will transplant a lot and there are steps that you can follow to make it successful.\nThanks to Moreno for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on The Dutch Farmer’s channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nHow to transplant efficiently Prepare No Dig beds The No Dig approach is a way to make market gardening successful because it works similarly to how nature works.\nIt is about:\nnot digging or tilling the soil keeping the soil covered at all times with organic matter Why is it an efficient approach?\nIt feeds the soil web It keeps the weeds away It makes it very easy to transplant. Tools to use You can find a variety of tools to mark the beds:\na wide rake with rigid plastic tubes spaced to your needs a bed roller with pikes to make holes in the soil a grider The rake is the cheaper and the grider is the most efficient tool.\nTransplanting (from 5:00) Once the beds are ready, you will need to loosen up the individual transplant without damaging them.\nThen, you will simply lay at each intersection of the grid you drew earlier one transplant.\nTo keep your strength and health\nEither:\nwork on your knees work with your legs bent But refrain from standing up and bending down as it will kill your back over time…\nFinally, the transplanting is straight forward: since the soil is loose, you simply put 2 fingers in it to make a little hole in which to plant the transplant. Finish with ferming the soil around it.\nHarvesting the winter crops Again, always work on your knees.\nLet’s take the example of turnips.\nFirst, if the weather is warm in the early spring, then flea beetles may infect your crops. This is why neeting with a fleece can become important, especially for turnips that are a profitable crop.\nThe flea beetle’s attacks can decrease the photosynthesis and stress the plant resulting in a poor quality turnip.\nIf you sell turnips with the leaves, it could turn away the customers with damaged leaves.\nSo always grow turnips with a fleece cover.\nMoreno uses simple elastic to bundle up 3 to 5 turnips together.\nCleaning up the yellow leaves is a good idea.\nAny turnip that is too small, chicken will love the snack :)\nOnce the turnips are bundled, you will need to wash them and control the quality. In fact, besides the flea beetle, root maggots are another pest that can damage the root vegetables from the ground.\nIt makes the sale of turnips impossible when they are damaged.\nIn early spring, this is when the adult flies lay eggs and the larvas go into the soil to develop and eat.\nWhat can you do without using chemicals?\nUsing a netting, rotating the crops and keeping your soil healthy will help to keep the turnips healthy.\nAnd remember, even the organically approved chemicals are just as bad as conventionnal ones!\n","date":"2023-04-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/market-gardening-in-april-the-dutch-farmer/images/_hu77c9a12a9c221ac07396435abe1f531e_209286_cae86a857ca231eacbb70eeb3297bd1a.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-04/market-gardening-in-april-the-dutch-farmer/","title":"Market Gardening in April, by The Dutch Farmer"},{"content":"In 2023, there are a lot of solutions to build your digital presence.

I had a couple registered with Infomaniak, but I’m dropping them this year.\nVuePress hosted on Netlify and GitHub I have been looking for a lightweight and cost-effective solution to build and host websites for a long time.\nI tried simple HTML files, custom PHP application and WordPress.\nEven if I use WordPress for my clients because it gives flexibility for them to update content themselves, I didn’t want using it for my personal needs.\nAs a software engineer, I wanted something quick, easy and with the least dependences possible.\nI discovered VuePress as I started learning about VueJS in 2021.\nAt first, I used a custom theme of VuePress 2, based on the default theme. Then I discovered Mr Hope’s theme which provides all the features I need.\nIt allows me to:\ncustomize the styles, navigation, features I need write articles quickly in Markdown which VuePress transforms into static HTML files deploy automatically the website with little efforts. I have built a template repository with multilangual support with a minimum setup if you’re interested.

In all these usecases, the cost is limited to the custom domain name if the my-website.netlify.appisn’t enough.\nWordPress and Divi hosted on Infomaniak I use WordPress and the Divi builder through Infomaniak hosting for clients.\nIt’s very cost-effective with an hosting plan starting at about 112 euros per year (depending on the sale offers at a given moment).\nIt includes a domain, a email account and a web hosting with the Divi builder for free.\nThe manager dashboard is great and more intuitive than OVH’s.\nThe features available really appeals to me who likes to script deployments. Even though I can’t do all I can on Cloudways (see below), I can do enough to automate a lot of steps when deploying a WordPress site for a client.\nAlso, the fact that Divi comes for free when you purchase a hosting plan is a good plus.\nIn terms of cost, you will need to pay for the domain and hosting. For a .frdomain and the bare minimum hosting, it costs about 112 euros per year, which may be more than OVH or GoDaddy or IONOS, but the features and performance of Infomaniak beat them clear and square.\nAt the moment, I use this setup for:\nL\u0026rsquo;ensemble instrumental Tournon-Tain (a symphonic orchestra in the city where I live).

Because Infomaniak is more expensive and less performant for half a dozen demo WordPress sites than a VPS.\nIt costs me $11.34 per month to keep on a minimal VPS running. Cloudways take care of all the server maintenance for me.\nI only need to update the WordPress sites now and then.\nI have built a custom workflow to deploy those websites using bash scripts. It’s very similar to Infomaniak scripts.\nI really like Cloudways because you have access to many features that are usually locked with shared hosting.\nCompared to Infomaniak\u0026rsquo;s shared hosting, the different is that you own your server and nobody else works on it. At Infomaniak, a VPS cost 30 euros per month at minimum (and yes, it has more power than the 1 GB Digital Ocean droplet).\nContact me if you’re interested about the deploy scripts or using Cloudways.\nFor newsletters At the moment, I use Substack only.\nWhy?\nBecause it’s free and customizable to reflect your brand.\nThere are two drawbacks so far:\nThe localization isn’t great: when you speak another language than English, you can’t set everything in your language. Even if the membership feature is easy to set up (connecting with your Stripe account), you can only setup subscription in US dollars. I’m hoping for an update soon to solve the first issue soon.\nFor the membership issue, read on.\nFor memberships I’ve got no subscribers as of March 30, 2023. But I\u0026rsquo;m working on that thanks to Darius Foroux\u0026rsquo;s Digital Business school training.\nHowever, I have a Stripe account with products in English and French.

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on The Dutch Farmer’s channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nOverwinter crops Moreno planted spinach in September and they’re really taking off at this time of the year.\nAnother crop that could work if it survives the winter is green onions. It’s planted at the same time of spinach.\nAlso, winter carrots are ready for harvest and, in market gardening, it’s a great thing to have organically grown carrots in March.\nWhat can we plant now, in March Aspargus and strawberries They’re crops that you can plant now.\nMoreno is planting them between a fence of garlic: the strawberries between every 2 garlic and the asparagus in the middle of the row, as shown below.\nPersonal note\nWhat I have found about the Alium family is that it’s a great repellant for slugs.\nI planted my strawberries in the fall of this year, at the same time as the garlic protecting them.\nPeas They can withstand up to -6 °C so they’re a great crop to plant now.\nIt’s a crop on the low end of the profitability scale. However, it can offer diversity to the farmer’s customer.\nTo create the peas’ fence, Moreno uses:\nwooden poles spaced by 1.8 m a simple net with a large-sized mesh Then he applies the same amount of compost (2–3 cm thick) in a narrow row and sows the seeds about 3–4 cm apart.\nPeas grow vertically: this is a very good thing when you have limited garden space.\nBecause of that we easily add lettuces, arugulas, beets or carrots at the base of the peas. In fact, the crops won’t compete for sunlight and you will get more out of the small area.\nOverstory trees Trees are a vital participant in a farmer’s garden.\nHow is that?\nThey consume the carbon dioxide of the air through the photosynthesis and transform it into a carbon that will feed the soil and its life. They attract a wide variety of fungi and bacteria. They in turn feed on the elements given by the tree.\nIn return, they give away nutrients that the soil life will consume. Finally, the soil life produces the food for the crops that produce our food.\nTree and their root system can hold 10 times more water than soil with no organic matter. It’s really something to take care of because water is a really precious resource.\nWorking with the soil lifecycle, introducing perennial plants and trees is a key way to make sure we can survive on the Earth and take care of it.\nAnother factor in favor of this is the diversity it brings to the garden. Compared to a single crop field, grown on bare soil, do we see the difference?\nPersonal note\nHow do I plan for a sustainable garden?\nI have added about 10 cm to 15 cm of autumn leaves on all the beds in November and December.\nYesterday, while planting the potatoes under that blanket of leaves, I could see the moisture about 5 cm down. That is really nice when you know we had a month of January that is the the driest in a long time (no rain in more than 30 days).\nIn early 2023, we’re already seen warning of a serious drought. Covering the beds adds resilience to the soil.\nMaybe we may grow more on highly industrialized farms, what about the quality and the sustainability of such methods?\nAren\u0026rsquo;t respectful gardening techniques more profitable in the long term even if yields are lower?\n==Thinking about it before buying your next carrots from your supermarket or the tomatoes that shouldn’t be available at this time.==\nSee the detailed explanation and point of view from Moreno at 8:10 to 11:00\nExperimentations It allows creative thinking is a key to success.\nMoreno is trying out turmeric and ginger!\nPersonal note\nI’ve been wanting to try this also! Let’s see how Moreno goes about it.\nFirst, start small when experimenting.\nThen,\nbuy clean and mold-free rhizomes from a local organic shop cut them in 4 cm to 5 cm long pieces let the piece to heal from the cut for 2 to 3 days. soak the pieces in water to speed up the germination. plant pieces of turmeric or ginger in compost. The germination can take a few weeks up to a few months.\nIt’s important to keep those tropical plants at 20 °C minimum so they can grow.\nIndoor is usually a good place to start growing them.\nOnce the leaves start to appear, you will be able to move them outside under cover.\nSeeding How does Moreno go about seeding in trays?\nHe uses the 2 cm wide trays as shown above the lettuces.\nFor other crops requiring more root space, he uses the regular sized pots as shown below.\nPrepare the potting mix Water it so it’s moist but not wet. See Moreno showing the squeeze technique from minute 16:31.\nFilling the tray Make to double-check the filling of the side and corner hole.\nOnce filled, lift and drop from a 25 cm height the tray to compact slightly the medium.\nComplete the filling of the holes where necessary.\nSeeding the seeds Use your fingers or a little pointy tool to create a small depression on the compost mix.\nThe depth depends on the crops, but usually, for lettuce, 1 cm or 2 cm will suffice.\nThen, sow individually the seeds, add another layer of compost mix to cover the seeds and water a little again.\nLabel it and date it\nPersonal note\nI use a GLORIA Hobby 100 Pressure Sprayer (available in France, in the UK; in the US, this brand doesn’t seem to be available.).\nIt’s quite handy as you can adjust the spray finely. Also, it’s sturdier than a bigger version sprayer (not the same brand) of 5 liters capacity. It broke twice after a year :( So I recommend a 1 liter like this Gloria model.\nComposting Laying the fresh compost directly on the beds in France isn’t a good idea because it can become a perfect slug habitat.\nSo, instead, if you can have chicken, feed them with your compost.\nIt will provide fertilizing matter and eggs.\nMoreno uses a 3-section compost pile to use the chicken’s work to enrich the compost and produce an aerobic compost.\nHe sets the fresher material in section 1 and let the chicken work. Then he moves the pile to the section 2 when the pile shows advanced decomposition In the section 2, the chicken will continue their job and the bacteria and fungi will multiply Finally, he moves to the section 3 to let the compost finish. It’s a great to go from:\nwaste to crop production waste to egg production Personal note\nYou can make all your own compost yourself? Yes, but it will require time and a lot of energy.\nThe compost need of garden is pretty important and even if you’re quite fit, don’t you need to keep some energy for more important tasks when you could get cheap compost locally?\nLook at the place around, ask small businesses selling plants and trees. They may know where to find good compost.\nMoreno buys his high-quality compost at 10 euros a cubic meter. To produce himself a cube meter of finished compost, it would require 12 hours of work [3 turning of 4h for a pile of 5 cube meters at the start].\nEven at a 15 euros per hour labor cost, you can see that the sustainability of producing compost yourself is simply not profitable.\nCompanies specialize in producing good compost. Perform a cost analysis before diving into making your own compost.\nYou may be surprised.\nHowever, you should make some of your own compost. Simply find the best balance between making it and buying it.\n","date":"2023-03-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-03/market-gardening-in-march-the-dutch-farmer/images/_hu0920812fee3969fb78cfdc31a232306a_218608_715cc0c2cb2d313f3e3ecbd1138934db.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-03/market-gardening-in-march-the-dutch-farmer/","title":"Market Gardening in March, by The Dutch Farmer"},{"content":"What was true in January is still applicable in February. However, during the month of February, we’re seen at the end of the winter\u0026rsquo;s tunnel. Moreno will go into more depth about Market Gardening for this month.\nThanks to Moreno for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on The Dutch Farmer’s channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nKeep on propagating and planting shrubs and flowers We should continue to propagate the shrubs and aromatic plants to multiply them.\nAlso, if you can afford to buy and plant flower bulbs to increase the diversity on the farm, go for it!\nCrop planting plan Now is the time to complete the plan for the year.\nYou will need to organize the seeds, the tools to be ready when the sowing and planting will start.\nThat includes finishing the last cleaning of garden space so they’re all ready to receive the crops.\nHarvest of winter crops If you did plant winter crops, you will continue getting the crops, weather-permitting, of course.\nFor example, what you planted in August and September last year could still be available for sale.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take kale: in February, it’s still producing and it’s a hardy (meaning resistant) and it’s the most profitable crop at this time of the year.\nUnless you live in a cold climate, where you will need a greenhouse or a polytunnel, then you go for kale next season.\nAnd even if you live in a colder climate, using fleeces (white cover sheet) you can add protection so the crops perform better.\nBe careful of damage to the fleeces\nIn fact, if your beds are positioned under trees, the falling branches can damage the fleece that is actually no thicker than toilet paper.\nIn my experience, I think it also depends on the quality of the fleece. I personally use this fleece for Winter Garden cover which I bought already 2 years ago and this year. It holds very well over time.\nIn the vlog, Moreno harvests carrots sowed during the previous summer.\nWorking with the birth-death cycle of nature As a farmer, you work to extract the most nutrient out of the soil to grow annual crops.\nIn nature, the ecosystem would look like what you see in a forest, with trees and perennials. It’s self-sustaining.\nOne of our jobs as annual vegetables grower is to bring fertility to our land so we’re as close as possible to the natural cycle. This is a key way to continue getting predictable and quality yields year after year.\nHow does work After harvesting the remaining crops and tidying up the beds, you apply a 5 cm layer of compost evenly.\nAbout not enough broken-down compost\nMoreno showcases a non-mature compost in the vlog.\nIt contains quite a lot of wood.\nIt isn’t a problem as long as it isn’t tilled into the soil.\nIf you apply it on the surface, the roots will go down below that compost while it finishes breaking-down.\nUsing a one-year-old cow manure compost would be much better.\nFor Moreno, he made a deal with a local farmer owing cows. The farmer sets aside a big pile of cow manure for a year and using a aerating machine, he breaks down the manure into a perfect compost for market gardening.\nAfter you applied the compost, you can also firm up the layer with a nice little tool called a bed roller.\nFor more details about low-cost tools for market gardening, check out this vlog from Moreno which I will cover someday.\nClean pathways with woodchips Woodchip serves 2 roles:\ncreating clean and tidy pathways feeding the soil as it starts to break down. It’s an amazing added element to the garden.\nIt acts as a sponge for an excess of water and it brings fungi that are an important ingredient to good soil life.\nIn a way, it’s like adding a blanket to the soil, protecting the soil underneath from the weather.\nFinally, you barely get dirty boots with a woodchip-covered pathway 🌟.\nIt isn’t a must to apply woodchips, but you have them available for free or a small cost, definitely use them.\nDirect sowing in February Be careful: winter ain\u0026#39;t over!\nIt will depend on where you live, but in a 7B climate, you can still get frost up the first week of May.\nIt would be a shame to lose early-sowed crops in one cold night.\nCheck out the gardening climate using this link from Gardenia.net.\nSo what can you plant?\nMoreno lives in a 7B climate zone and will direct sow:\narugula radishes turnips mustards spinach kale Undercover, you can also plant beets and carrots.\nIn an unheated polytunnel, you can also start seedlings for other crops for the Brassicaceae family like cauliflower, broccoli, cabbages.\nLettuces, fennel or some Swiss shards are also crops you can start seedlings for.\nAlso, for slow-growing plants, like peppers and eggplants, they need a lot more time to getting start and therefore they will need heat. February is the perfect time to start them if you can afford the cost of heating mat.\nHowever, count the cost: is it worth the money to grow from scratch those vegetables as you will need to allocate a cozy and protected place in your home?\nDo you have a local farmer handling large number of seedlings for those crops? Maybe prefer buying your plants from him instead.\nUsing a jang seeder for arugula The jang seeder is a great tool to sow large number of seeds when working on a market garden.\nYou need to follow a couple of important steps:\npick the right roller for the seeds to plant. For arugula, you will need the YYG24 plate. install the plate into the hopper, which is the case that holds the seeds. weight the seeds you use to plant the beds to calculate the production cost of the bed and the crop. keeping a spreadsheet to record what you use and produce is important for a sustainable market garden. See the previous post for details. To choose the density of sowing for arugula, you will need to choose your goal:\nif you need to grow small leaves, then go for a high density (the 6-row seeder is then a better-suited tool) if you need to grow larger leaves, then the jang seeder is used. After sowing, place a fleece into the top of small steel wire hoofs\nHard frost\nA very hard frost can kill the seeds even with the fleece. You take a risk by seeding now.\n","date":"2023-02-07T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-02/market-gardening-in-february-the-dutch-farmer/","title":"Market Gardening in February, by The Dutch Farmer"},{"content":"Even if you know it might be a little too early, it’s hard to resist starting sowing seeds. Huw shares with us what we can sow in February.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nSo what can we sow in February safely enough?\nJerusalem artichoke Personal note\nBefore I begin with Huw\u0026rsquo;s notes, I have to say these are the only vegetables I hate because the smell and taste really put me out. Growing up, we had some (thankfully not too often) but every single time I had to eat some, I almost threw up.\nI know it was what replaced regular potatoes during the last great war, but I\u0026rsquo;d prefer eating wild plants than this\u0026hellip;\nThey’re easy to grow and they grow in the same space year after year.\nThey do spread and unless you have got limited space, it won\u0026rsquo;t become an issue.\nPersonal note\nEven I hate the taste, when I look at the outer plant, I see 2 purposes this crop can:\nproduce green material for composting provide food for pollinators as its big yellow is filled with juicy nectar. It’s impossible to plant Jerusalem artichoke without digging a trench 30 cm deep.\nApply a 4 cm layer of well broken-down compost and set each seed 30 cm apart (same for rows).\nTo eat them, Huw roasts them a pan with salt\u0026hellip; Maybe that\u0026rsquo;s the trick to start liking them?\nCalendula or pot marigold It can come back on its own if the weather is a little warmer. It will give you an early flourish in may when you transplant them.\nYou can use the petals as a safran-alternative in cooking or refreshing summer drinks. I wonder how this summer drink is made.\nHumble pea Starting early in February under cover will provide you with crops for a long period.\nThe ambassador variety yields good result usually.\nGrowing them under a polytunnel will extend the growing season and provide us with an early harvest.\nBroad beans You enjoy them in the late spring and early summer.\nThey’re easy to grow, hardy and super productive.\nYou can eat the shoots, meaning the top of the plant that is tender than the rest.\nYou need to know that bread bean send out a deep root, so if you sow them in modules, you will deep-cell modules.\nAbout field beans\nThey’re like a smaller version of a broad bean.\nThey’re also very productive and delicious.\nPersonal note\nI’m not sure what is Fèves in English. I’m currently growing some, sow last November and again a few weeks ago.\nThe November ones are out since the end of December and I covered them with a winter cover.\n\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;\nAlium family We\u0026rsquo;ll talk about two: onions and shallots\nEven if you can start from seeds, Huw prefers starting from sets, e.g., these:\nYou plant them in modules like shown above.\nWhatever method you use, pick the one you like and prefer and enjoy the process.\nPotato Potatoes don\u0026#39;t like frost\nSo make sure you can quickly shelter them if needed.\nHuw grows them in containers to start with. He uses a container of 50 liters so it’s more manageable.\nHe usually plants them in mid-February and the harvest comes, weather dependent, in May or early June.\nAfter harvest, he reuses the compost for beans or squash\nPersonal note\nI will plant some this month and since it’s still quite cool outside, I don\u0026rsquo;t expect them to be out before April or May.\nPlus, I cover my beds with a 15-20 cm layer of a small dead leaves so they have got a blanket to keep warm.\nPeppers They need a warm base to help the germination.\nThey need more to grow and now, in February, is ==the time== to start the seedlings.\nConclusion So, are you ready to kick-start the growing season?\nI sure am in action already.\nMy next actions are:\nonions potatoes To finish, please consider signing up to my newsletter to receive all the new articles each week.\n","date":"2023-02-06T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-02/7-most-productive-edible-crops-to-sow-in-february-huw-richards/","title":"7 Most Productive Edible Crops to Sow in February, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"Woodchips can be useful for the garden but breaking them down take ages. With a few tips, Charles explains us how to speed up the process to obtain a rich compost material.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nHow to break down woodchips Johnson-Su bioreactor It’s used to decompose the woodchips by using this system and making sure the woodchips are properly watered.\nPersonal note\nI’m planning to build one to experiment.\nI’ll use the resources found in this Google search to get started.\nCheck out the image tab in the search.\nDon’t burry woodchip\nSince Charles is the no-dig advocate, he doesn’t bury the woodchips and he warms us that if you dig and burry the woodchips.\nThey will suck the nitrogen out of the rooting zone and it will deprive your plants and vegetables of what they need.\nOn the surface, it’s fine because the plants and vegetables will set their root under the woodchips.\nAfter breaking down a pile of woodchip compost from a bioreactor, you get the following.\nLater in the vlog, Charles explains more about the pipes in the bioreactor.\nIt’s supposed to help maintaining air in the heap. But is it necessary?\nWoodchip by its natural structure will allow air to be present, hence why we can add it to the compost heap to give the greener material a breath and prevent sludge.\nIn that other bioreactor, Charles added chicken manure and the temperature is consequently higher than the uncovered pile described below.\nUncovered pile of fresh fragmented woodchips With fresh fragmented fresh wood (which is what Charles presented, not the dry woodchips), you will get some activity.\nAlso, there is no problem with conifer wood, in Charles’s experience. He feels that the pH level with that kind of wood, once well decomposed, isn’t an issue. I have found that to be true as well for the few years I used them from a source of Douglas wood.\nAgain, with a pile, you will need to water it if you don’t get enough rain.\nThe more green the material you get in the woodchip, the faster they will decompose. It isn’t more true in the summer.\nCharles used a lawnmower to the breakdown of the woodchips after 4–6 months of winter decomposing.\nGreen material will decompose faster than the wood pieces, and after 9 months, Charles found out that there are a lot of woodchips left.\nUncovered pile of regular woodchips When I say regular woodchips, it means with no green, in particular the ones you can get in the sawmill.\nIt decomposes slower, but it will provide some useful materials with time.\nHere a microscope comparison of the Johnson-Su bioreactor and the regular woodchips.\nPatience is key You can get the woodchip to a pure humus state.\nEven if you can use water and moisture to speed up the process, you will need significantly more time to decompose woodchips.\nWhen you reach the humus state, then you have a very good addition for the garden.\nPersonal note\nFrom what I saw, it seems that the bioreactor setup speed up the decomposition, very likely because you have got a managed structure.\nWith a pile lying on the ground, you can’t keep the moisture has easily. And watering the pile may use more water than the bioreactor contained environment.\nHow to use woodchips Charles uses woodchips in 4 ways:\npathways woody material for compost heap (when it’s a few months old and already decomposing) burning it filling a bed Pathways Woodchips on pathways has several advantages :\nit keeps your boots clean it will eventually provide a source of food for your plants it helps to keep the soil firm, not compact. Filling a bed with 2-year-old woodchips To finish, how does it compare to grow vegetables in 2-year-old woodchips “compost” to regular homemade compost?\nBig pieces of wood and slugs\nBe careful of the large wood piece that can shelter slugs…\nWhat Charles experienced was a very poor start, with a lot of yellow leaves for 6 weeks.\nAfter 6 weeks, Charles thinks that the roots got through the layer of woodchips and it ended to be successful, even if less productive.\nConclusion Try it yourself.\nTry to get the smallest sized woodchips, if you can. But it’s hard to choose what you get.\nOtherwise, use the lawnmower technique.\n","date":"2023-01-18T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2023-01-18-woodchips.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-01/5-ways-to-break-down-and-use-wood-chips-charles-dowding/","title":"Way to Break Down and Use Wood Chips, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"What does a day in January look like? The Dutch Farmer will detail it to us.\nThanks to Moreno for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on The Dutch Farmer’s channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nIt’s a slow and relax month when we can:\nreflect on the past year, analyze the data from the past year of harvest, and plan accordingly for the coming year. The days are gray usually in January but the days are lengthening and that means more sun.\nEven if January is a slow and relax month, you can still do a lot in the garden.\nHarvest of the remaining crops At this time of the year (and in the south of France as it’s where Moreno shot this vlog), you can still have the following crops to harvest:\nspinach kale parsley Swiss chard In Winter carrots beets Cleaning Also, anything not harvested, or that didn\u0026rsquo;t make it with the first frost, needs to be cleaned up.\nYou can use those wastes for the next compost.\nAlso, you can give away those old crops to the chicken if you have any.\nThen, you finish preparing the beds with a fresh layer ready compost to fertilize the soil for spring.\nDiversify the farm\u0026rsquo;s income streams To create a resilient farm, you need multiple income streams.\nWhat does it include?\nproducing various types of crops to sell on markets\ndedicate an area to perennials and create a plant nursery:\nincluding berries like currants, black berries and medicinal plants like rosemary, thyme, lavender and sage sell vegetable transplants for the community\nproduce microgreens\ngrow mushrooms if you have the place and resources for it.\nSmall farm market gardening: a good business The initial investment is relatively low compared to the traditional farming process.\nMoreno made a vlog about the tools you need to get started.\nIt’s possible to do such an activity on a rented land.\nSo, producing various types of crops to sell on markets is the first income stream and the first goal to start a farming business.\nYou need to focus and give everything within your abilities to make this business functional as soon as possible. Once you reach the functional stage, then you can venture out into creating other income streams.\nStart to make a living then play around and experiment.\nMoreno transformed a very grassy land into a very productive farm using no dig. He details the process in this vlog.\nPruning trees and bushes Clearing bushes will give the plant the opportunity to give new growth as the spring arrives.\nPruning trees will provide more energy to the branches you need to keep produce the next year\u0026rsquo;s fruits. Those branches will bloom with new flowers and leaves more efficiently.\nAlso, cleaning the garden, especially bushes, makes it less inviting to the slugs.\nIncrease biodiversity If your soil isn’t frozen, plant bulb flowers, like tulips and amaryllis, that will provide beauty in the garden and early food to the pollinators.\nAfter a long winter, it’s very nice to hear the bees buzzing on the first flowers.\nIt’s our job as caretakers of the land we use to provide food sources to the wildlife.\nAnother example is to hang up bird feeders and housing for them as they’re your allies to eat the insects you want them to take of.\nIf your land is welcoming, wildlife will come to it.\nPropagate shrubs When they lose their leaves, the shrubs become dormant until spring.\nYou can then multiply them using the cutting or division technique.\nEither way, you prune a branch of what you want to multiply. You should prune a pencil-thick branch so it can work successfully.\nThen, cut them into 10 cm to 25 cm pieces before placing them in pots filled with compost.\nThis technique works great for:\nroses blackcurrants redcurrants blackberries grapes figs For example, Morena once created 7 new trees from a single branch. Similarly with 2 blackcurrant stalks, he creates 10 new blackcurrant plants.\nAnother multiplication that you can do is dividing a root into several pieces.\nFor example, with rhubarb, you create 12 new plants with one mother root. You just need to make sure each piece contains a crown.\nPersonal note\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure I will find a vlog that explains this in detail.\nEarly sowing Do this only if you have a polytunnel or a greenhouse to start sowing lettuces or spinach, for example.\nOtherwise, you should wait until March.\nWork on projects and planning Since the garden needs less time from you, you can design, build or repair what you need for the coming year.\nPlanning is crucial so you have enough seeds to create seedlings that will produce the vegetables to sell.\nThe technique is to start with the goal in mind.\nHow much do you need to earn to live your chosen lifestyle, pay the bills and save. Moreno goes into more details on this vlog untitled How to Start a Farm From Scratch (Beginner\u0026rsquo;s Guide to Growing Vegetables for Profit).\nAs always, stay tuned as I take more notes about Moreno and his vlog on his Dutch Farmer channel.\n","date":"2023-01-13T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-01/market-gardening-in-january-the-dutch-farmer/","title":"A Day in The Life of a Farmer in January, by The Dutch Farmer"},{"content":" In January, we don’t like going outside because it’s cozy inside. But, maybe, you’re like Huw and, in reality, you need to do some work in the garden. Let’s what\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’ channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nJanuary is a synonym to preparation. For example, you can start with spreading a load of compost on the beds where you don’t still have food growing, like cabbages or Swiss chard, very useful for the Hungry Gap.\nWhen you tidy your garden, you can reflect on the past year and find out what your plan will look like for the year to come.\nFor example, you don’t want to change your raised beds in the spring but during those winter months.\nUsing a tarmac rake\nThose rakes are heavier than the normal rake because of their end use.\nFor spreading compost, they’re also great to help us spread up the compost.\nHuw thinks that you need to apply a 5 cm to 7 cm compost layer on the raised beds yearly to replenish the nutrient content of the soil.\nPersonal note\nTo put this in concrete numbers, a 5 cm layer of compost on a bed 100 m² garden (which is useable for the crops and excluding the alleys), you would need 5 metrics cube of compost or 5000 liters.\nWhere I live, to get that much compost would cost a fortune. At 10 euros a bag of 70 liters, it would cost 714 euros to cover the beds…\nThere are places where you can find compost in bulk for a lower price. In my case, I can’t have it delivered because the minimum quantity is 10 tons!\nI could go rent a truck to hold about one ton, equivalent to 2000 liters, for about 115 euros (of which the compost costs just 26…).\nGetting compost when you start feels like a challenge!\nThe when to put the compost depends on what you will grow. In general you will apply compost between autumn and winter. However, you will apply it also in the summer for the Brassicaceae.\nJanuary is about planning It’s a simple month but it’s a key one.\nUse the time to plan what you will grow, where, with what other crops.\nUse the past year’s experience to adjust what didn’t work to try out something else.\nPersonal note\nI have a lot of ideas and I’m currently writing a journal of all I will do in the 2022–2023 year.\nFor me a year begins with autumn harvest time is over until the next one. So it falls around October.\nSo far, in summary, I picked up a lot of leaves from a nearby park (about 12 metric cubes) to not only cover my garden with a keep-warm blanket but also make more compost.\nI also planted broad beans and garlic.\nI planted another kiwaï vine (Actinidia arguta) because:\nthe first one we planted 3 years ago has provided its first fruits this year and it tastes so good. It’s auto-fertile which is easier than the regular kiwi vine (we have a male and female and for 8 years, we had flowers but no fruits).

It depends on the winter harshness.\nMaking your own potting compost You have dry compost? Sift it to 4 mm.\nGetting good potting compost from the gardening supermarket can yield surprising results, not always providing the same growth year over year.\nDedicate an area for aromatic herbs Having thyme, rosemary, sage, fennel and mints add flavor to the garden and the meals.\nOnce planted, you will need to add some woodchip yearly as the old ones break down.\nThose plants don\u0026rsquo;t need a highly nutritious soil.\nSee how it looked back in June 2021 in this vlog.\n","date":"2023-01-10T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-01/winter-vegetables-in-january-charles-dowding/","title":"Winter vegetables in January in years 1 and 10, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Thanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!

Composting tips I’ll put here only what Huw hasn’t already shared in more recent vlogs.\nOne tip that he hasn’t talked about a lot regarding nitrogen rich material: it’s urine. Of course, you will need to dilute it.\nAt least, Huw is consistent between 2013 and 2022: he has been consistently saying to put 1 part green for 2 parts brown material in the compost bin. Also, he suggests again not to compost meat and dairy to keep the rats away.\nNext, it isn’t a good idea to compost pet manure, from cats and dogs, for example.\nFirst, I find that they really stink\u0026hellip; Second, Huw mentioned they contain microorganisms that you don’t want because of the diet of those pets (most carnivores). However, mostly vegetarian pets like guinea pigs and chicken can work fine.\nThe interesting fact is that the tip about to keep the compost bin warm. It makes me think of the tip from Charles Dowding. He builds his compost bin fully closed on the side.\nPersonal note\nI have made 2 compost bins lately and I did make them fully closed, making sure to layer well the green and the brown to always oxygen to stay present.\nOne thing he insists on is to keep too much rain away in the compost. Charles Dowding recommends the same. I therefore made some tops for my compost bins.\nFinally, similarly to Charles Dowding: he recommends to ask around to gather more nitrogen-rich material, as it will be the resource that you will struggle to obtain in sufficient quantity (unless, you have a huge lawn 😅).\nBuilding pallet compost Huw is building his compost bins from pallets without making sure the sides are full. See above for the model I’ve made.\nAdding weeds in the compost You can, but as long as the weeds haven’t gone to seed.\nYou can put the weeds with seeds if you can build up a compost bin with a lot of heat. Above 55 °C, the seeds won’t survive.\nSand in compost The advantage of sand would be to help with:\ndrainage on clay soil. root vegetables to grow nice and big because of the smooth texture. However, a soil that drains too much means a poorer water retention, which means you will need to water more often.\nSo maybe, I’d suggest to use it on the first 10 cm max, but always mixed with soil.\nHuw didn’t put much anyways.\nThanks for reading.\n","date":"2023-01-03T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2023-01/some-more-tips-about-compost-huw-richards/","title":"Some more tips from Huw Richards about compost, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"A hot compost means compost ready quicker.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!

You want to create your own to feed your garden.\nTo make compost, the recipe is simple:\n2 parts of brown 1 part of green (coffee ground, grass clippings) In the vlog, a friend of Huw suggests you need air to feed the material degrading.\nHowever, Charles Dowding said that as long as the compost heap remains moist but not wet, there will still be air in the material, coming from the way you pile up the material.\nPiling up the material is done in layers and the brown layers allow air in the pile.\nWhen you live in a dry area, especially in summer, you will want to have a water source available to keep the compost moist.\nThe moisture is what will keep the living organisms breaking down the material of the heap.\nIn my area, 1000 L of compost cost 150 euros if purchased in bags.\nI could get compost in bulk (26 euros for 2000 L organic-graded compost), but I\u0026rsquo;d need to rent a truck which is over 3 times the price of the compost…\nThe two methods to get the compost hotter:\nbuilding a 0.7 meter cube compost heap turning the compost Why a large compost heap It does retain the moisture better, therefore, the micro-organisms\u0026rsquo; activity is increased.\nHowever, it will also consume more water as heat in a compost pile means life and life needs water, no matter the form or size.\nIs turning really worth it Huw suggests that the second way to turn the compost.\nMixing the pile kickstarts the microbial activity.\nPersonal note\nI’m not sure I\u0026rsquo;d want to spend the energy turning the compost often just to keep the pile hot.\nCharles Dowding\u0026rsquo;s method appeals to me more because you focus your energy to find more material, especially the green materials, to build up the compost pile.\nThe more green material you add, the more heat you can get and therefore, the faster you will have compost available.\nWhat is true is the following: whether you turn the compost pile or not, you don\u0026rsquo;t want to compact your compost pile.\nAir is one of the key ingredients to make compost.\nA third way As I said in my personal note, adding more nitrogen will increase heat.\nNitrogen means more green material.\nNow, what isn\u0026rsquo;t explained in the vlog is how do you get enough green material?\nFor that, I invite you to read more on the topic of composting.\nAs always, don\u0026rsquo;t forget to subscribe!

Let’s see what tips Huw has to share.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nYou can call a garden “a garden” if you don’t make your compost.\nCompost is turning your waster into soil food.\nThe location of the compost bin Ideally, it needs to be in a corner and it needs to be in the share.\nIt needs to be close enough to the source of materials you will put in the bin.\nFinally, set your bin high up so you don’t have to climb a hill to your garden.\nBuilding the compost bin There are many designs, but to my opinion, use pallets.\nIf you’re a family and don’t run a farm, don’t buy anything else other than screw or nails and a bit of wire. Look at this article detailing the process.\nIf you’re running a farm, then this article won’t explain how to build compost bins optimized for large-scale operations. However, have a read of the notes I took so far on the compost topic by Charles Dowding. He runs a little business and he has a large 6-heap structure.\nWhat materials It’s again simple. You have green material and brown material.\nHuw lists the most common greens and browns.\nGreens:\nHorse and cow manure Rabbit and Guinea Pig droppings Used coffee ground Kitchen vegetable scraps Garden weeds which haven’t flowered Grass clippings Spent brewery grains Browns:\nAutumn leaves Shredded paper Newspaper and cardboard Dried grass What ratio of brown and green Huw makes it simple once more, despite the numerous recipes out there.\nYou want to simple mix 2 portions of brown with 1 portion of green.\nThen you empty the material in the following order: brown over green.\nYou will then build up a lasania (e.g., layers) compost heap.\nThis method is called slow composting because the heat is what speed up the composting process.\nHowever, you need a lot more green materials in general and, trust me, it’s difficult to get plenty of material for hot compost.\nProblems and troubleshooting Lack of nitrogen: if the compost takes over 12 months to be ready, add some more manure or greens.\nSmell: if you put too much nitrogen, the heap might stink. You can easily solve that with an addition of a brown material.\nCompost too wet: with too much water in the compost, the bacteria don’t thrive as well as if it was just moist. You can solve that with laying cardboard on top of the compost pile.\nIdeas to get more material to put on the compost pile Ask your family, friends and neighbors to give away their compostable wastes by providing them with a container Ask your local coffee place to collect coffee grounds Ask your local shops to spare the cardboard boxes that you can easily use in your garden and on the compost bin.

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel.\nYou can watch it using this YouTube link.\nA potting bench The potting bench includes:\nA working area made of a few wood planks where you can empty the compost. A table where you will put your tools Module trays of various sizes (deep-rooted for peas and beans, or shallower trays for general-purpose seeds) Labels made from recycled materials How to make your labels\nHuw mentioned yogurt pots.\nI use the wood of an old crate.\nA box for unfinished seed packets It’s very rare to sow a full packet of seeds, so keep those in a sturdy box, away from the humidity and sun. Seed or multi-purpose compost\nHuw had found that seed compost is too expensive for the actual benefits and multi-purpose compost does a good job for propagation.\nWhere to put the seed trays One limitation of growing seedlings is a lack of space.\nThe simple trick is to use shelves to rest the trays.\nIf you have mice problem, do like Huw: set your most precious or less attractive-to-mouse seedlings higher!\nWatering seedlings It’s a good idea to have a small watering can for fragile seedlings like lettuce.\nOr if you’re like me, I use a GLORIA Hobby 100 Pressure Sprayer (available in France, in the UK; in the US, this brand doesn’t seem to be available.).\nIt’s quite handy as you can adjust the spray finely. Also, it’s sturdier than a bigger version sprayer (not the same brand) of 5 liters capacity. It broke twice after a year :( So I recommend a 1 liter like this Gloria model.\nIf you’re sowing on a warm month, after you have sown the seeds and watered the tray, cover it with a brown cardboard to retain the moisture.\nThat way the seeds will germinate better (especially true for carrots as James Prigioni shared).\nYou will need to check daily until you see the seedlings come out.\nAlso, you will need an area where you can take out your seedlings out to water them. On the shelves, it’s often not practical.\nThe height is also ideal with standard 80 cm pallets.\nCheckout Charles Dowding’s vlogs where he tells us more about it.\nPreparing the trays The steps are simple:\nFill the trays with compost Press down with your fingers on the compost Fill the trays with some more compost Water the tray on the ground if it’s quite dry Create some holes where you will sow the seeds in each module Sow enough seeds. See this article from a vlog of Charles Dowding for a few examples. Gently fill the holes with some more compost Why before sowing\nHuw likes to do this because once the seed is in the module, the water can displace it.\nAlso, you won’t need to water again after sowing if the weather is overcast.\nCold frame A cold frame is a structure that you have outside with a glass top, like an old window.\nIt’s the final stage to prepare the seedlings to acclimate to the lower temperatures, yet with no frost risk.\nHuw mentioned it rather quickly at the end.\nI have got a lot of old wooden windows that I’d like to use to build either a cold frame or a tiny greenhouse.\nStay tuned!\n","date":"2022-12-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/propagation-setup-for-annual-vegetables-huw-richards/readme./","title":"My Propagation Setup for Annual Vegetables, Compost, Watering, Space etc, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"The garden produces a lot around midsummer.

Rust will infect the plants in such weather.\nSaving seeds It’s a important job to become self-sufficient to grow your own crops.\nIn July, you can get leak and spinach seeds.\nBeetroot Huw transplants them around that time of the summer.\nLeaks Huw transplants them around that time of the summer.\nThey usually replace the cabbage like kale.\nWildlife and pollinators If it happens that you have a nest of bumble bees, preserve it!\nIt’s so beneficial to the garden.\nA bumble bee’s nest is usually found in the ground. So watch out before you tramp it…\nSwiss chard They need watering otherwise they will bolt after 3 to 4 weeks of dry weather.\nWhat does bolting mean in vegetables?\nBolting is the term applied to vegetable crops when they prematurely run to seed, usually making them unusable. A cold spell or changes in day length initiates this behavior.\nSource: www.rhs.org.uk\nYou can still use the leaves.\nSalads Lettuce will bolt easily.\nHowever, Huw talked about a variety well known in Asia that doesn’t bolt as easily. I will put the name here once I get the answer from him in the vlog.\nSweet peas Huw loves the fragrance of the sweet pea flowers in the early evening.\nAnd pollinators will love the bed where they’re planted.\nPolytunnel in July At this time of the year, you will find that the jungle is on!\nYou can plant tomatoes under the polytunnel.\nPersonally, I grow them without any protection. This year 2022, I haven’t taken care of them and the drought this past summer was really too hard to keep up with the watering.\nWhat else The end of July and early August is not only the time of harvest, but also the time to perform a well-planned succession of crops to get the most of the same area.\nAlso, you shouldn’t worry too much about crops rotation because it will save you a lot of hassle.\nIt might not be true to all the gardens. You will need to find what works best for you.\nI have tomatoes in the same bed for eight years.\nI have planted potatoes randomly (basically, where I had space) and I have very likely planted in the same place again. This year, we even had volunteered potato plants from an area where we had some last year.\n","date":"2022-12-16T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/late-july-garden-tour-huw-richards/","title":"Late July Tour of a 100% Organic Kitchen Garden (Only Feed is Compost), by Huw Richards"},{"content":"It’s easy to make your own.

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nIt’s important to prioritize making your own compost the following tips are short-term adjustments.\nIf you aren’t making enough compost, by the end of the article, you will have an action plan.\nCompost levels The first tip is to mix compost and top soil together to optimize the use of compost.\nUsing 1 part good compost and 3 to 4 parts top soil is a good start.\nMulching When you don’t have enough compost, mulching with alternatives happens to be a solution:\nwoodchip dead leaves About perennial plants\nThey aren’t super nutrient hungry plants for using woodchips will suffice them.\nGrass clippings It’s the most underutilized material and you must get grass that wasn’t sprayed.\nGo ask around your neighborhood and it’s very likely, if you don’t live in the city, that you will find people delighted to give away their grass clippings.\nThe important thing when applying grass clipping is to apply it in thin layers, maximum two to three centimeters, especially in a UK-like climate.\nWhy? Grass clippings can make excellent slug accommodation and your plants won’t like it!\nAlso, it can form a thick sludge that can smell.\nIf you want to be sure, sprinkling the grass on the soil will be fine. Perform the task in the morning of a sunny and the grass will decompose rather quickly.\nApplying grass is easy because it produces a lot and you can sprinkle it once a month.\nWood ash and coffee grounds In wood ash, you will find charcoal that, once broken up, can soak up all the nutrients and provide a slow release of those nutrients to the plants.\nWood ash is high in potassium and phosphorus, both good for plant growth. However it’s missing nitrogen.\nThat is when the coffee grounds come into the game.\nThe myth about coffee ground being too acid isn’t a reality, according to Huw (others like Charles Dowding).\nIn fact, when you brew the coffee, a lot of the acidity goes away.\nSo, you mix those two ingredients and you apply around the plants a sprinkle of the mix once a month. It doesn’t need to be too much.\nIf possible, do it right before some rain or watering. The water you will help the mix dissolve and go down the plant’s roots.\nChop and drop technique Comfrey is a must-have for the gardener.\nI do have half a dozen plants that I’m starting to propagate. The plant provides a huge quantity of nutrient-rich leaves. It can replace animal manure.\nThe advantages of comfrey are numerous:\nLetting comfrey flower is a fantastic bee restaurant. It’s a dynamic accumulator: its long tap root brings up a lot of the minerals in the soil. It’s a compost activator It is great for mulching beds Liquid feed The advantage of liquid feed is that it provides soluble nutrients to the plant.\nUsing comfrey again, you make your own within 2 or 3 weeks.\nSee this article for a detail explanation about liquid feed.\nThe result will stink, but it is fine. Your plant will thank you for it!\nDiversity From all those methods we have detailed, don’t use one of them only throughout the year.\nIt will create a nutrient unbalance in the garden. In nature, you will find out that diversity brings success.\nUse the little but often approach of a range of different solutions.\nHomemade compost It is huge not to rely on buying compost.\nSacrifice some of you growing space to make your own.\nThe biggest challenge is to gather material. I find this very true and it requires a lot of ingenuity to find sources.\nOne key advice I’d give is to look close to you. You will be surprised about how much your neighborhood has to offer.\nBulk compost If it is available in your area and if it is approved for organic gardening, go for it. For Huw, it cost £40 per ton.\nThe closest I can get is 26 euros per ton, but I need to rent a truck to bring it home, so in the end, it cost 115 euros per ton\u0026hellip; I’m still very hesitant at the moment.\nYou can maybe purchase it as a group, hence lowering the cost. In my case, I can have it delivered but I will need a rather big storage area because they only deliver a minimum of 10 tons!\n","date":"2022-12-07T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-12-07-a-man-planting-spinach.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/free-solutions-for-short-term-gardening-success-huw-richards/","title":"How to Grow Food WITHOUT Compost | Zero-Cost Solutions for Short-Term Vegetable Gardening Success, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"Sometimes, we think of making compost as a complex process, but, in reality, it’s easy to produce high-quality compost.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nWhat is compost To start off, let’s define compost: it’s the breakdown of organic matter into beautiful rich humus.\nThe few key things about lazy composting You need bins of 1 meter long Why? It isn’t going to warm up as easily as in a dalek size bin. It needs a larger size bin to be able to build up the warmth.\nThat warmth and heat help to break down the material.\nThe ingredients You will typically add:\ngreen material: grass, vegetable waste, coffee ground… brown material: dead leaves, wood, cardboard… About grass clipping\nApply it in a thin layer (2–3 cm maximum) because it can get sludgy if too thick.\nPersonal note\nI have found that mixing grass clippings with wood dust helps build a thin compost and helps to avoid the sludge.\nRatio of green and brown Huw tries to go for a 1 part green for 2 parts brown.\nBut, with lazy composting, he doesn’t overthink it. But you will need to follow one key rule.\nYou need diversity Two or three ingredients aren’t enough.\nThe more you add diverse sources of material, the more balance the compost will be in terms of pH and nutrients.\nWhen a bin is full The only thing to do: press on the material to compact it a little.\nPut on some boots, climb in the bin and jump!\nJumping in the compost bin\nDon’t do it if you didn’t build a strong structure 🤣\nFinally, cover the compost with cardboard to keep some rainfall off the compost pile. You want moisture but you don’t have anaerobic environment.\nWhen is lazy compost ready It will take longer, because it doesn’t get as hot.\nSo instead, two to three months, it will take between six and eight months.\nHuw uses the technique of smelling the compost: if it smells like the forest floor, then it’s ready.\nThen you can apply it to the beds as a cover for winter.\nWhat about rats You will get rats if you put in cooked food, diaries and bread in the compost bin.\nAnd wouldn’t you prefer having them in the compost bin or your food storage?\nHow many compost bins Three bins appears to be a good target:\none is usable for the garden one is full and is starting to break down one is being filled Therefore you will have compost available most of the time!\n","date":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-12-06-the-art-of-lazy-title-overlaying-someone-handling-fennel.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-12/the-art-of-lazy-composting-huw-richards/","title":"The Art of Lazy Composting or how to Make High-Quality Compost the Simple Way, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"A gardener can’t have too much compost and in fact you may not be able to create enough. Huw will give tips to how to improve that.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the vlog published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nBase layer Use a very fibrous material like straw or small branches.\nFor example, old nettle stems work well.\nIt will provide enough oxygen at the base and it’s key to help the microbes thrive and develop to break down the material in the compost.\nSpent compost It can come from buckets, module trays, hanging baskets.\nWool It’s a natural ingredient.\nYou need to tear it up before throwing it to the compost bin.\nSeaweed If you live near a sea, you can take advantage of the seaweed you can collect on the beaches.\nCheck regulations in your area\nApparently, harvesting seaweed is regulated in some places… Ask before you get into trouble.\nRegarding the salt impact on the compost created, you can lay out the seaweed on grass so rain can wash the salt off and then put it in the compost bin.\nGrass clippings I took notes about another vlog from Huw on the topic. Check it out using this link.\nIn the compost bin, you need to make sure you collect pesticide-free grass.\nDecomposed woodchips Cardboard Huw suggests to tear it up before putting it in the compost bin.\nThen give it a soaking because it’s a dry material.\nUsed coffee grounds It isn’t always easy to source this ingredient. Look for a shop or a pub that used a lot of it.\nSourcing organic coffee ground?\nUse caution about the origin of the coffee. Maybe no coffee ground is better than coffee ground from coffee grown with pesticides and other chemicals.\nStill, it’s high in nitrogen and it boosts the microbial activity.\nDead leaves Collect as much as you can and bag them to use later during the year.\nPersonal note\nI’m currently gathering a lot of them. So far in early December 2022, I harvested 8 cube meters of dead leaves in various sizes.\nI use it mostly to apply a blanket for the beds during winter.\nAlso I use it to add to my kitchen and garden compost bin as well as the composting toilet waste after emptying the bucket.\nRatio of various ingredients You may wonder:\nHow much do I put of this? How do I put of that?\nTo keep it, simple, Huw suggests to mix up the ingredients with a fork.\nAlso, you can apply each ingredient in layers and if you have 2 ingredients in each category of green and brown material, spread each in several layers so no one is too thick.\nBalance the green and brown material Huw uses this ratio: for one bucket of green, he puts one or two buckets of brown.\nBut you don’t need to measure precisely the amount you put in.\nInvest in composting Composting is much better than investing in stock markets!\nIt doesn’t cost anything often except your time and ingenuity to source material around you.\nIt helps you grow better and stronger vegetables that will help you reach more self-sufficiency in food.\nStart now!

You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nThe source of the idea Liz Zorab inspired Huw with this concept.\nShe uses a lot of woodchips in her garden alleys. After a while, she observed that the woodchips had turned into a dark broken-down material thanks to the traffic in the garden, the rain, the wind and the duck roaming.\nShe then told herself that she could use this woodchip compost in her garden.\nthen, you simply fork it from the pathways to the beds right beside it!\nWoodchip hybrid compost Huw suggests a hybrid solution, using kitchen scraps and other garden waste to create a nitrogen-rich compost.\nHere are the steps:\nProtect wooden beds If you go for this technique, you will need to protect the wooden beds with an empty compost bag, for example.\nApply a cardboard base Especially if you have grass paths, it’s ideal to apply a layer of cardboard.\nIt still allows earth contact between the soil life.\nCalculate the volume of compost it can create In Huw’s example, his pathway measures 3 meters long and 55 cm wide. He planned to put a 15 cm layer of material.\nHe would get about 250 liters of compost in the end!\nHow beneficial is it If you have beds like Huw that measure 3 m by 1.2 m and you apply 3 cm of compost, 108 liters of compost. So with one alley, you can deal with the two beds surrounding it!\nApplying the materials apply a 3 cm layer of woodchips, as the base layer. throw on top of it any weeds that you find in the nearby beds. add more shredded cardboard. add your vegetable waste or comfrey leaves. add kitchen scraps (but add something else on top like leaves or more cardboard) .6. finish with a good soaking if you lack rain. You can also add a few sprinkles of leaf mold.\nSpeed up the process and maintenance Walking in the pathways is the first step. Your weight helps to break down.\nDo add regularly water, more material as it slowly breaks down.\nIt will bring enough air to the organisms breaking down the materials.\nWhat’s next Try it yourself with a portion of your garden pathways.

Because if you apply a too thick layer, it creates a sludge and an anaerobic environment.\nIn practice, you don’t want to apply a layer of more than 2 cm to 3 cm thick.\nAlso, the other trick is to mix it with another material, like cardboard.\nIt will become ready within 2 months.\nDrying out grass clippings Grass is considered a nitrogen-rich material.\nHowever, drying out grass transforms into brown material or carbon-rich material.\nMultiple mulch options The benefits of mulching with grass are:\nweed suppression (if you use grass with no seeds of course) moisture retention If slugs aren’t a worry for you, you can mulch your beds with a 2–3 cm layer.\nIf slugs are a concern, you can still use grass but sprinkle no more than 1 cm.\nIt’s easier to apply it when the plants are small.\nAdding grass as mulch will build up organic matter because one molecule of organic matter holds up to four molecules of water.\nIt will help the long-term health and water retention capabilities of the soil.\nMulching potatoes Huw is growing potatoes in containers. He adds a good 5 cm layer of grass on top to keep the moisture and hope that he won’t need to water them.\nHe tops up with more grass as it starts breaking down.\nWatering Apparently, watering is more effective. Why?\nWhen you have a dry soil, the water will often run off.\nWith grass clippings, it simply won’t. The grass captures the water and slows it down to the soil.\nJADAM liquid solution from grass clippings Read all about JADAM in these notes I took from another vlog from Huw.\nCheckout Youngsan’s website for more details.\nJADAM liquid solution has a balance pH and you need to apply it throughout the plant’s life, up to the flowering or fruiting stage.\nFor the case of grass, here is the process Huw suggests.\nYou will need:\nRain water Leaf mold or really old homemade compost An opaque container The procedure is simple:\nFill the container to 70% with fresh grass nearly to the top while pushing down gently to put as much as possible\nAdd the water to cover a little bit over the grass.\nPress down the grass if necessary\nSprinkle the leaf mold\nAbout light\nWith fermented products, it’s better to keep the light away.\nTwo weeks after, you can use the JADAM liquid in a 1:30 ratio. As it ages, it gets better and therefore, you will need to adjust the ratio: see the details here.\nThe interesting thing is that you can top up with water the container for years while you keep the solids in. Adding additional organic matter of the same plant (in this case grass clippings) is also an option as the original matter has decomposed.\n","date":"2022-11-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-25-grass-clippings-in-a-lawn-mower-bag.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/grass-the-most-valuable-free-resource-huw-richards/","title":"Grqss, the most valuable FREE resource for growing food, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"Instead of buying expensive and dangerous plant feed, learn to make your own now.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nThe technique is easy, very cheap.\nWhen it’s even more important to use it When rain isn’t falling, when compost prices increase beyond what we would expect, gardening can become challenging.\nHuw believes we can grow food in a way that saves money.\nAnd when finance challenges us, we learn to focus on the things that do matter.\nWhat really matters in the garden is:\nthe health of our plants at the end of the day, the health of the soil, the joy to be in the garden, and providing food for the household. The recipe requires one expense: the container where you will put it in.\nAll the other ingredients are free!\nIngredients Water Any kind of soft water will do. The free source is the rain water.\nThe network water usually contains chlorine and we don’t want to have any microbes. To make this amendment, we rely on picking ingredients containing local microbes that will provide the proper nutrition to the plants.\nLeaf mold You need more than a handful.\nFor city people\nYou can use a well-decomposed compost instead.\nThis ingredient is the inoculant, it brings the biology that will help to make the amendment.\nPlant matter You can use any plant matter.\nAnd you create a crop-specific feed that will change a lot of things in your garden.\nWhat is JADAM JADAM organic farming comes from Youngsang Cho who wrote a few books on the topic: check out his website.\nOne of the teaching is that the plant is its own fertilizer. By creating a liquid feed, you have the optimum elements to grow strong crops.\nPersonal note\nIt’s game-changing in a world where many think we need industrial fertilizers.\nWhen you can make a liquid feed with so little effort and at a price that beats anything, why would one go for industrial fertilizers?\nAs an example: a fruit tree will produce leaves and fruits that will fall to the ground, decompose and feed the tree for the next year. JADAM uses the same principle.\nOptimum liquid amendment To make any liquid amendment, you need the plant fresh to make the liquid.\nYou need to use the entire crop, not just the leaves or the roots.\nPersonal note\nThat means that you won’t be able to make this amendment until the crops are growing already.\nThat might be tricky if your don’t have a lot of the particular plant.\nHow to create a high-quality feed Since you need to use the whole plant, you will use what you eat.\nThe good news is you don’t need that many.\nDon’t worry about sacrificing some of the crops!\nOne caveat JADAM is designed for big agriculture operation.\nWhen you have a little garden, how are you going to make all the specific liquid feeds for your crops?\nHuw suggests to create a group or family of amendments. For example, make a Braceassus amendment for the family of cabbages, broccolis and so on.\nDisclaimer: he hasn’t tried and will tell us how this work out.\nPersonal note\nThis caveat came to my mind.\nI’m blessed to have a local free source of 5 liter containers. I get them from buying sauerkraut in them.\nWe eat a lot and we can get about 1 container per month from November to March.\nThe recipe Decide what plant matter you will use. Cut and smash the big piece to help with the breakdown. Fill the container full. Add soft water to cover the plant matter. Sprinkle a handful of leaf mold or good compost. You don’t need to mix the leaf mold.\nFinally, put on the container lid loosely.\nDone!\nWait two weeks before you can use in a dilution\nDilution ratio You can use a 1:30 ratio with soft water.\nAs the JADAM solution ages, you will need to increase the ratio.\nDilution ratios (approximate): 2 weeks: 1:30 1 month: 1:50 3 months: 1:100 6 months: 1:200 1 year: 1:400/1:500\nHow to use it Use it as a supplement.\nIt isn’t about getting massive crops but more about healthy and nutritious-densed crops.\nMore traditional feeds You can continue using:\ncomfrey feed to help tomatoes or grass feed for seedlings (see GRASS - The Most Valuable FREE Resource for Growing Food). How to maintain your JADAM liquid feed As you extract liquid from the container, never take any of the solid.\nAs the liquid levels go down, top it up with more water and more of the exact same crop.\nIt will be smelly :)\nNot everything has to be aerobic.\nIt’s easy to fallback to JADAM liquid feed\nAs we saw, since it’s easy to make, and rather fast to become ready, we can rely on this method.\nTransplanting with JADAM liquid feed When you transplant a plant, adding some JADAM liquid feed to the water used will help the plant get the minerals and nutrients it needs.\nAlso, get into the habit to use JADAM liquid feed once or twice a month when you’re watering. See the ratio above.\nTakeaway Start making your JADAM liquid feed now, no matter where you’re at when you read this.\nI will make more comments about the technique in a year time.\n","date":"2022-11-24T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-24-a-cut-plastic-bottle-filled-with-some-brown-liquid.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/easy-low-cost-plant-feed-to-boost-vegetables-huw-richards/","title":"EASY Low-Cost Plant Feed to Boost Crop Yields \u0026 Health, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"Having enough compost can challenge any gardener. Let’s what Huw what it suggests to do.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nTrick 1: Consider a break year This is a year you don’t put any compost on an area.\nIt isn’t something you would do to start with, but rather you use this trick down the line after a few years of mulching.\nTrick 2: Dedicate an area to crop that doesn’t need a lot of nutrients For example, legumes, like filed beans, adapt well to poorer soil.\nTrick 3: Compost directly on the beds When you apply compost, you add carbon, nitrogen, microbes and nutrients.\nBut simply said, compost is old plants decomposed.\nThis is what Huw calls Chop, Move and Drop.\nFor example, if you grow comfrey (which is a great and easy green material you need in your garden), chop it down, take it and apply it over the beds.\nTrick 4: Use grass clippings before it turns to compost It’s like trick 3, but, in this case, you need to apply it in a thin layer (2 cm to 3 cm) to avoid rotting.\nAbout grass clippings\nBe careful to put on grass clipping to avoid:\nSowing a lawn…\nHuw Richards It helps retaining moisture to keep the plants and the soil life alive.\nAbout slugs\nIf you have a lot of slugs, use 1 cm layer of grass clippings. Otherwise, they will hide under it and feast on your vegetables.\nTrick 5: JADAM microbial solution You will find the images of the recipe in this short vlog Do This With Potatoes To BOOST Soil \u0026amp; Plant Health and goes as follows.\nThe tools:\na square piece of fabric The ingredients:\n2 small boiled potatoes a handful of leaf mold 5 g of sea salt Instructions:\ncut the piece of fabric smash the potatoes on the fabric add the leaf mold tie the fabric into a sachet put in an opaque container pour and knead the sachet with rain water (or soft water) add the salt mix well cover After 1 or 4 days, depending on the weather, you will see bubbles creating, which means microbes multiply in the solution.\nTo use the solution,\ntake 1:20 of the solution mixed with rain water (or soft water). apply it to the garden It provides:\na big boost to your plants a kick-start to the microbial activity and a help to break down the material into your soil. If you apply the solution once a month in the poorest beds, it’s going to make a lot of difference.\nTrick 6: Trench planting It consists in making a trench in which you will dump kitchen waste.\nThen you cover it with a little bit of soil and plant whatever you need.\nAs the plant grows, the kitchen waste will be already decomposing and it will provide to the plant the nutrients from that degradation.\nTrick 7: Plant fermentation You can make some from:\nstinging nettle grass clipping swede and many more To make it, check his details vlogs on the topic:\nEASY Low-Cost Plant Feed to Boost Crop Yields \u0026amp; Health GRASS - The Most Valuable FREE Resource for Growing Food ","date":"2022-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-23-7-free-tricks-to-grow-food-with-limited-compost-huw-richards.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/7-free-tricks-to-grow-food-with-limited-compost-huw-richards/","title":"7 FREE Tricks to Grow Food With Limited Compost, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"What can you do to prepare for the winter in your garden?

At the time of this writing, I have gathered 6 meters cubes already.\nCollect grass clippings Huw suggests to use the leaves collected before and spread them on your lawn.\nThen use your lawn mower to mix the leaves and grass clippings together to obtain a 50/50 mixture great to put on the compost heap.\nPlant field beans (Vicia faba) Huw lets them grow during the winter and cut them before they flower in the spring to create a green manure and cover crop.\nConduct a tool and seeds audit You want to work out what you have left in terms of seeds.\nAnd check your tools:\nAre they working? Are they sharp and do they need sharpening? When the Spring time comes, you will be ready to start your planting, seedlings and so forth.\nMulch your beds with seaweeds Seaweed is full of minerals.\nRain can wash the salt.\nMulch your beds with compost Continue planting (if you own a greenhouse or a polytunnel) Continue planting allows us to keep the soil full of life as the plants grow.\nDon’t forget to water the indoor beds!\nGreen tomato Chutney What is it?

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nStarting disclaimer No everybody has access to the same resources and the same amount of each.\nAlso, we have different numbers of spaces to make and store the compost.\nIn this vlog, Huw showcases *his method to become self-sufficient in compost.\nDefinition of self-sufficiency It can be different for all of us. To Huw, the goal is to create all the mulching compost he needs for the garden and for transplanting.\nHowever, at the time of the shooting, he still purchases seed compost (e.g., potting compost) because he hasn’t perfected his own yet.\nSelf-sufficiency is a journey that takes time.\nTypes of compost We find the following:\nstandard compost, the one you apply in a layer of 2 to 3 cm each year on your beds. inoculated compost nutrishous compost and the fourth one can be in The Living Soil Handbook from Jesse Frost. It’s available in France, in the UK and the US. It provides clear and detailed tips to build up life in your soil.\nJesse describes the four types of composts in depth.\nHow much compost Huw’s favorite bed size is a 3 m by 1.2 m with a depth of 20 cm (rough estimate from the vlog).\nFor a mulch layer of 2 cm, it will require 100 liters of compost.\nCount the number of beds you have and time that by 100 liters. It will give the compost amount you need for your garden.\nAlso, take a 20% extra so you’re sure not to run out.\nPersonal note\nOf course, not everyone can build a garden with the same rectangular frame.\nFor instance, my garden has a weird shape, so the beds are rarely rectangular.\nSo make your beds with creativity, using the space efficiently,\nAlso, using the material you have available for free can decrease your bill.\nMaking compost Remember: compost is decomposed material, it means that the original materials have been broken down and you will get about one third in the volume of what you put in on the heap.\nOf course, this ratio is dependent on what you put on the heap.\nWhen you look at the compost you need to make, you might feel overwhelmed.\nSo Huw suggests to spread the load.\nMaking compost in the alleys Huw spreads all kinds of material in the alleys between the beds.\nIt equals to about 10 cm to 15 cm layer. When it\u0026rsquo;s ready, he sifts it.\nThat way he can get about 200 liters of compost, enough for the two beds.\nChicken compost Checkout EdibleAcres and Geoff Lawton channels that talk about this topic.\nThe advantage of chicken compost is that the chicken will eat the seeds they find in the bedding.\nWorm compost This compost is usually very nutritious. It’s used more as a supplement rather than a sole use for your garden.\nHot beds It’s more a gardening technique than a compost making technique.\nBasically, it’s about using the warmth of compost in the making to grow vegetables you wouldn’t grow in certain times of the year.\nAnd at the end, you have harvested the crops that grew in those hot beds and you will find yourself with a huge amount of great quality compost.\nSourcing materials Grass clippings Huw thinks it could work well on the previously mentioned deep mulch chicken compost.\nAlways be on the lookup\nWhen you make your compost, you will need to be mindful to the material you can gather to make your compost.\nPeople throw a lot of things that can go on the compost heap.\nI’m preparing to look around my area to see who would be giving away their grass clippings, saving them time as they don’t have to go the local public waste factory.\nWoodchips Woodchips come not only from the freshly cut branches, but also the sawmill.\nThe first type, called fragmented rameal wood, comes from the small branches. Their width shouldn\u0026rsquo;t exceed 7 cm in diameter.\nThose branches contain more nutrients than bigger pieces and, with two to three years, you can use it as compost.\nSaw dust Saw dust creates a fine texture because of its natural form.\nSo using compost with a good portion of saw dust might just be the good recipe for potting compost.\nAnd you may wonder if it isn’t too high in carbon and that it might suck the nitrogen out of the ground. Well, it’s always a matter of balance. You won’t apply saw dust as is the beds. You will mix it with some green material and let it degrade.\nPersonal note\nHaving used saw dust the past year to make my compost from grass clipping mixed the saw dust and kitchen waste, I have to say that the result in terms of texture and look seems promising.\nI will use it next year and I’ll report my findings.\nA word of caution\nMake sure the wood saw dust you collect is free from preservatives before you plan to put it on a compost heap.\nDead leaves Same as saw dust, dead leaves are available and cheap, and mixed well with green materials, you can create a great compost.\nPersonal note\nI use leaves as my winter duvet for the garden in a 10 cm to 20 cm layer.\nSince I don’t have the best orientation in the winter with about four and a half hours of sun (weather permitting), I don’t plant anything during the winter months.\nLast year was my first year applying this covering and by the end of this year harvest, I can tell you, the leaves have all disappeared.\nI think it has helped to create a smoother soil, from which I can more easily pull out the weeds.\nCoffee grounds It’s high in nitrogen, so you can assimilate it to a green material.\nOther materials Obviously, your kitchen waste participate to filling the heap.\nPersonal note\nI put in 5 liters of kitchen waste daily, mainly vegetables waste.\nThe local highly available weeds can become a great source of material. Huw has a lot of bracken (Pteridium) around his garden.\nCardboard suits a lot of applications in the garden: from covering in the No Dig method to brown material additions to the heap.\nGlues on cardboard\nHuw tells glues are almost always strach-based, meaning they come from a plant-based source.\nBut, verify your sources.\nHuw lives near the coast so he harvests seaweed from the coastline after a storm or a high tide.\nHow to remove the salt\nLay it on the ground a little while then let it dry and it will be ready to use.\nFinally, using cover crops produces a lot of materials to bulk up the compost heap.\nCheck out the channel David the Good as he explains it in these vlogs.\nSet goals that you can attain The first challenge is to gather the materials. Finding a place to pile it up won’t be a challenge.\nSo for your first year, brainstorm:\nwhere you can get the materials, then build your heap using wood pallets finally, start filling the first heap Within a year, you will have your very own homemade compost.\nPersonal note\nMy goal for the 2022–2023 year is:\nFinding more sources of grass clippings closer to home, even if I can get a trailer-full of it from the mowing my company loan (I know nobody spray anything on it). Asking my local organic store for coffee grounds Getting more saw dust from the local sawmill that is only 5 min from my house. Growing more comfrey because it gives out huge leaves!

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nBefore you sow You have applied compost on your beds with compost in the beginning of the past winter.\nNow, before you sow your seeds, use a rake to break up the remaining lumps of compost to create a nice smooth surface.\nUse your feet to break any lumps. Walking on a compost bed is fine because it needs to be firm and you can’t compact compost by walking on it.\nSowing carrots with radish Draw lines with a wood stick (if you don’t own a triangular hoe).\nMake them not too deep (about 3-4 cm).\nSowing in compost is absolutely fine, unlike some may say.\nRadish tip\nIf you sow your radishes with your carrots, you will know where the carrots are. The first sprout very quickly while the latter take more time to come up.\nFinish the sowing with covering the lines drawn with compost and walk on the lines to firm the compost once again.\nPlanting seedlings grown in modules The tool to perform the task is a spade handle which has a slightly pointed and round extremity that is perfect to make holes in the soil.\nYou can create your own with a tree branch or an old space handle.\nThe width of the handle or branch should be about the same as the modules you’re going to plant.\nTo plant lettuce, use a spacing of 25 cm so that you can let them grow big.\nCharles picks up the outer leaves to eat for a long period of time. It provides a lot of food from the same plants.\nWhen you plant the seedlings, set them deep so they’re sturdier.\nCovering a bed with fleece When it’s still early spring, you may need to install a fleece (a white cover to protect the plants from the cold).\n","date":"2022-11-20T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/spring-sowing-and-planting-charles-dowding/","title":"Spring: sowing and planting into surface compost outside, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Charles explains how to sow more seeds in a smaller area and which vegetables work best with multisowing.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nThis system is applying to more people than Charles’s huge compost heap I have taken not about. See my other notes on the matter using the Compost tag.\nA brief explanation of the system Charles simply uses wood pallets, from which he knocks off the bottom to make them more lightweight.\nThen he attaches the sides with a wire at each top and bottom corners.\nWith no posts in the corner and no weeding out the area, those heaps require no complex site preparation.\nIt’s really simple to make.\nHow long does it take to fill the heaps For Charles, it takes two months with his large garden (one and a half acres).\nIt might take less for you. Hence, you will need to adjust the size of the heap.\nPersonal note\nFor example, I don’t produce nor possess enough material to fill a heap made of full-sized pallets.\nSo I made one from half of a pallet and I will see if I need bigger or not as I manage to gather more material.\nTurning the compost You don’t need to turn it often. Save yourself some energy!\nCharles does it once in the lifecycle of compost making.\nWith the presented heap system, you only need to:\nremove the wires from one side (see at 3:10 in the vlog) and use a manure fork to turn the compost from one heap to the neighbor (see at 3:20 in the vlog) The manure fork is easier to use than a digging fork. Buy one! If you can, look at the place where they sell second-hand items. I have found mine for 3 euros that way!\nWith a three-bay structure, you take the content of the side heaps into the middle one.\nTimings when making the compost Turning depends on how long it takes to fill the heap.\nI’m sure how long you have to wait, but let’s take this simple example.\nDegradation is visible when the content level of the heap decreases. If you fill full your heap, turn it when it’s half full.\nThen you simply follow levels in a given to know when to turn into the middle.\nWhy cardboard around the edges Popular sayings tell us that you need slatted sides to let the air in.\nCharles found out it isn’t true.\nWith cardboard, you keep in the heap:\nthe moisture the heat Creating an air hole Using a wood post or a tube, you can create an air hole in your heap.\nWhat about filling the heap in layers Why would you want to do that?\nIf you put a huge layer of grass clippings, for example, as it degrades, it might rot and air might not be sufficiently present.\nCharles provides a concrete example:\nset a 7 cm layer of grass clippings then set a 2 cm layer of dead leaves or paper or cardboard. In terms of volume, you put more green material than brown material.\nHowever, in terms of dry matter, it represents 50/50 ratio.\nAlso, even the green vegetable waste like courgette leaves contains:\nthe leaf itself (green material) the stem (more brown, even if it looks green ;)) About weeds and seeds You can put them on: bindweed, couch grass, flower seeds. Just put them in the middle and cover them well and they won’t reproduce!\nHeat provides what you need to kill the weeds and the seeds.\nIn this temperature range, you retain the fungi activity that is very important too.\nTo get a hot compost, you need nitrogen-rich material, aka green material:\nFresh leaves Grass Kitchen and food waste Fresh manure, either cow or horse Coffee grounds If the heat does go to high, you simply add more brown material.\nWhat about the size of brown material It’s important to cut, or shred if you own a shredder, the large and hard waste.\nCharles shows at 11:45 in the vlog how to trim a sunflower stem.\nWhy? It brings too much air in the heap.\nThe typical brown materials, aka carbon-rich materials are:\nSmall piece of woody material Old or dried tree leaves Dry stems Soil Paper and cardboard Watering a heap It isn’t always necessary, if it rains normally.\nBut if the weather is really dry, you will need to add water.\nHow do you know you need water and how much do you need?\nWell, it’s something you need to assess from your personal circumstances: weather, material you put in.\nIn the early stage, you decide based on how it looks and feels.\nLater, when the material has degraded enough, use the squeeze technique described in this article.\nConclusion Making compost is like taking care of a pet. Take care of it.\nAnd your vegetable beds will enjoy the great nourishment from it!\n","date":"2022-11-17T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-17-compost-heaps-made-with-pallet.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/4-compost-heaps-in-3-bays-charles-dowding/","title":"4 Compost Heaps in 3 Bays, ready in 6 to 12 months, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"The joy of compost is that you can turn any waste, even other people waste into soil food.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nEven in winter, you can do it, so let’s look at how and what.\nWhat can you compost Well, almost anything with no plastic, industrial wax.\nCompost heaps are amazing alchemical processes that degrade pretty much everything.\nFor example:\nPutting citrus on the heap isn’t popular or even it isn\u0026rsquo;t recommended. Yet, Charles composts them. Kitchen waste is usually more green material than brown. Wood ash to the contrary is very much a brown material. Charles recommends to put it on the heap rather than directly on the garden beds to use the full potential of the potass as it’s transformed in the heap. Stacks of vegetables (like cabbage) need to be cut into small pieces. The goal is to maximize the surface area that the bacteria will use to degrade the material. Fresh shredded wood is similar and is a woodier material. Coffee ground isn’t compost until you put it on the heap. It’s considered a green material. Also, it isn’t acidic, as some say. Yet, the numbers say that the pH is 6.8 on average. Vegetable leaves, especially when they turn yellow. Leaves turning yellow stop contributing to the plant’s development and, as they fall, the slugs will get involved. You don’t want that to happen. Weeds are scary, but when you can compost it. When you pull the weeds, you will get the brown from the soil that will come with it Also, popular belief says not to compost perennial weeds. If you continually add material to the heap, the roots of weeds you pulled will die. The heat will speed the process to kill them. Straw, if you have an organic Charles simply says to balance material with half green and half brown.\nWinter compost versus Summer compost The summer brings more green material.\nIn the winter, the brown material dominates more.\nCharles layers the material on the heap and you find air thanks to the brown material to help the green material to degrade.\nHeat in the compost heap You can make cool compost, heat isn’t a requirement but it speeds the transformation of the materials into compost.\nBetween 55 °C and 70 °C, you have what it needs to:\nkill weed seeds create a good environment for bateria and fungi How do you know the heap is finished Or in other words, when do you know you need to fill up another heap?\nYou can go on a long time if you don’t add a lot frequently.\nThat’s when the sizing of the bay is important: it’s better to have a smaller bay that you fill quickly than a bay too large that never gets filled.\nCharles’s three-quarter of an acre garden provides a lot of materials. He fills his six large bays (1.5 m by 1.5 m) easily.\nOne of his bays can contain one ton of compost.\nHe turns the compost once from the filled bay into the neighbor bay.\nWhat options for container When you can’t build a structure as big as Charles or if you don’t need so a large structure, use wood pallets.\nYou just need to cover the sides with cardboard to keep the moisture.\nConsistency of the compost Also, to keep the rain out, use a farmer plastic cover that sometimes they throw away.\nVery important\nYou want your compost to be moist, not wet. If it’s too wet, air is absent and bacteria can’t thrive in an anaerobic environment.\nIt’s often the missing ingredient of a compost heap!\nHow to check moisture\nTo check:\nPick up a handful of compost Squeeze it really hard If no more than two drops fall off your hands, the moisture is a good.\nDon’t just use the look of the compost to judge the moisture levels.\nWhat about the color A dark brown is better than a jet black concerning compost’s color.\nGreen waste compost is often very black because it was very hot and it might not be a good news. The level of microbes and micro-organisms is probably low.\nWell-rotted cow manure can make nice compost and it’s less dark than the green waste compost.\nFinally, the homemade compost with a very good balance of green and brown gives a lighter shade of brown compared to the cow manure compost.\nTurning compost Its purpose is to introduce new air in the compost and one doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to perform the task regularly.\nFor example, when the heap is full and of a brown color, you can turn it into another heap, like Charles does.\nTurning is also the occasion to break down the lumps.\nTurned compost is left alone for another few months.\nSifting the compost isn’t a must. When you want to use it for your potting, then sifting is necessary for obvious reasons.\nMyths of compost The following myths are more annoying than anything else:\nSeparating materials that are said not to go on the heap (ex: root of perennial weeds, citrus) Instead, cover them well so they can grow in the heap and you will be fine. Diseased vegetable leaves The diseases, like blight, can’t survive without a living host Heat is a must No, like I wrote above, it’s a bonus. You can make a great compost with no heat.

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nIn early summer, everything is growing fast. So you need to be present and be on the lookout.\nWeeding Even if the No Dig method with cardboard works efficiently, the weeds don’t die out right away.\nYou need to watch for them to come out here and there for a few months or even a couple of years after applying the cardboard and compost layer.\nThe sure thing is that you won’t get as much, so it’s reducing the work performed.\nTidying up the garden Interestingly, Charles tells us that the slugs like the old leaves of vegetables the most, kind of like they tidy up the place by eating what we won’t.\nThey have a role, they aren’t just there to annoy the gardener.\nSo here, we learn that to keep the slug away, clean the vegetables from old leaves. I’m interested to see how I can put this into action next spring.\nSuccession cropping In early summer, some vegetables near readiness for harvest, you will be able to replace the old crops with new ones.\nSowing in module trays the next crops in advance is key to maximize the growing seasons.\nFor example, you can sow beetroots in modules, 4 weeks before you harvest cabbages, so that they’re ready to plant right after the cabbage harvest.\nAnother example is replacing broad beans with cabbage in the beginning of summer.\nWhat can you sow in the beginning of June in the UK Boltardy beetroot\nIt’s a fast-growing variety and it can be used for early sowing.\nBeetroots are sown in pockets of about 4 seeds, remembering that some seeds won’t germinate.\nCharles thins the seedlings down to 4 beetroots per module.\nSpring onions\nThey’re sown in pockets of about 8–10 seeds per module.\nSpring onions are very versatile because you can eat them when they’re small, or let them grow into bulbs.\nGowrie swede\nThey’re sown in pockets of about 2–3 seeds per module.\nThen, you will need to thin to one root.\nWhat else? In mid to late spring, Charles sowed the following, which are ready to be planted in the beginning of June:\nRed cabbage Kale Leak Brussels sprouts Runner beans Cucumber Growing seedlings They will need warmth.\nIn early summer, it’s easy to have warmth, but for Charles in the UK, he puts his seedling in the greenhouse, watering them every day.\nMore about spring onions that grew during the winter Charles planted the spring onions below last August.\nIf you want to eat them, you need to watch out the seed head, unless you want to harvest seeds.\nA spring onion will turn a bit woody if left too long in the ground with the seed head growing.\nPlanting leaks while clearing space Charles clears out some kohlrabi sown in February, planted early April with a net on to prevent cabbage root flies to attack them.\nAbout cabbage root flies\nCharles doesn’t have a solution against the cabbage root flies except for the net over it.\nHe talked about another technique, but people have reported it doesn’t work.\nThen, you will need to remove any weed.\nYou can also walk on the bed, especially after harvesting kohlrabi or anything with big roots to firm the compost again.\nRemember\nWalking on your bed covered with compost, you can’t compact it. You’ll firm it.\nIn summer, you will need to water the compost if dry.\nWhy not make your bed too mounded\nWhen you pour water on it, even with a soil covered with compost, the water will run off to the sides.\nSo you want the bed to be leveled. It’s easier to water and keep the moisture on the bed.\nAfter you watered maybe a second time, you’re ready to plan the leaks.\nIf you want a longer white stem, you need to plan them deep.\nIntersow a new crop with another growing Why would you do that?\nOften, you will run out of space to sow the next crop.\nBut it’s possible if you intersow.\nFor example, Charles is sowing carrots between lettuce.\nYou will need to water well on the inside of the trench only so it’s efficient in water usage.\nTip\nWait a little bit before sowing the seeds, just like for the leeks earlier.\nSowing carrots requires precision. You don’t want too many sown in the same space. It’s always possible to thin them. But you could also save seeds by sowing just what you need.\nCharles advices to sow one or two seeds every centimeter.\nFinally, after putting back the compost over the seeds, walk on the compost to firm it up.\nYou don’t need to water more if you followed the watering of the trench at the beginning.\nTiming of planting You can easily plant too early. So learn about your climate and when it’s best to plant.\nCurry squash and climbing bean need warmth so planting in late may to early June for zone 8 in the UK\nIn contrast, broad beans (fève in French) are planted in November to December.\nThe same goes for celery, an early winter crop, that needs warmth.\nNext, Swiss chard also like the warm sun. Charles sows them in mid-April for a planting 2 to 3 weeks later.\nGrowing climbing beans with a tippee structure You have probably seen the structure of growing beans on a wall-like structure.\nIt tends to weaken against the wind, while tippees show more sturdiness, as they diffuse the wind coming onto them.\nAbout watering Watering well when planting is key. Use a good amount to make the soil really moist.\nThen, don’t water them for a while, the plants will then need to make their roots down, looking for water.\nBut it isn’t the case for lettuce. The vegetables you harvest regularly need watering the most.\nCoriander, spinach, peas fall in that category as well. Always depending on your weather, watering once every 2–3 days is enough.\nWith compost, it slowly releases the water to the plants, as it acts as a sponge\nPersonal note\nWhere I live in Ardèche, I do also water every other day.\nThe most difficult time is when the sun literally burns everything like this past summer.\nSo think about shading. It doesn’t have to block all the sun, but it will help tremendously to keep your crops alive.\nReminders about compost You need to give air to the compost, using a compost mixer tool, like this one that I use for two years now.\nI sue the technique of filling out my heaps in layers with green and brown. The green comes from the kitchen waste I throw away (5 liters per day) and the brown comes from dead leaves.\nYou can put weeds in the compost, but you will need heat. A big heap allows you to build up sufficient heat.\nKeep your compost covered, the worms will thank you for that as they like dark and moist.\n","date":"2022-11-14T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-14-homeacres-in-july-2018.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/early-summer-2018-at-homeacres-charles-dowding/","title":"Early summer at Homeacres harvests and speedy replant, intersow, weed, water and make compost, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Creating a raised bed with no dig is easy.

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nThis article provides you a summary of the trial Charles conducted to compare two composts to grow the same vegetables.\nThe trial setup Charles compares two composts:\nMushroom compost Composted cow manure Mushroom compost contains more nutrients than regular green waste compost.\nAnimal manure compost depends on the type of bedding that they were on.\nThe results On the strip with mushroom compost, the yields over 3 years were the following:\nComposted cow manure Mushroom compost 229.26 kg 251.94 kg You would have thought that cow manure would have produced more.\nIn detail No carrots grew up in the bed covered with cow manure compost. See below why. Potatoes, lettuce and chicory yielded a similar amount. Leeks and cabbages looked better in the cow manure compost. However, in that same compost, Charles feels like the broad beans note yielding as much as the other compost (mushroom compost), in the same area, may have left more nutrients for the next vegetables. Chinese cabbages aren’t doing well in the cow manure, for the same reason as the carrots. Squashes yielded more crops in the mushroom compost. Why those results Simply put: the little bit of straw brings snails and slugs eating crops.\nPersonal comments on straw I have found that straw helps to retain moisture. But autumn leaves provided me with a better result.\nAlso leaves keep the badgers away, or at least they don’t attract them as the straw does. Two years ago, I had replanted peas three times because the badgers came to plow the garden!\nLast year, with leaves, they still came, but a lot fewer times.\n","date":"2022-11-11T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-11-comparing-growth-of-the-same-vegetables--with-mulches-of-different-composts-charles-dowding.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/growth-same-vegetables-in-different-composts-charles-dowding/","title":"Comparing growth of the same vegetables, with mulches of different composts, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"The best way to discover something is to try them out!

But also, tomatoes, strawberries and lettuces will go yellow…\nHow can we remove aminopyralid weedkiller from the soil In a wet ground, it will break down into harmless compound.\nIt will take some time, though, dependent on the moisture in the soil and the temperature.\nSee below for more details.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t trust blindly the “wording” on compost bags Without any label or supporting certifications, saying something is organic has zeo value whatsoever.\nWhen you pick your compost, be really carefully.\nAnd run through the following checklist before you use it in your garden.\nHow do you check aminopyralid weedkiller impacts your plants Are the leaves yellow? Are the tips of the leaves of the plants distorted? It’s generally accepted that the trial to understand the effects of weedkillers on plants isn’t conducted well.\nA bioassay reveals the effects for the plant to assimilate the nutrients.\nA bioassay is a measurement of the concentration or potency of a substance by its effect on living cells or tissues.\nThis technique will tell you if the poison is present in the plant.\nIn the image above, Charles thinks the concentration isn’t very high in his trial but it’s definitely present…\nWhere is present Often, it’s present in horse manure, but also you can find it in cow manure or hay.\nEven a 10-year-old manure will contain it.\nHow to heal the contaminated soil You will need about 10 days of warm days and enough watering to break down the compounds in aminopyralid weedkiller.\nIt’s the soil life that will break down the poisons.\nHow does Charles know that?

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nCompost is a great entry point to grow a lot of vegetables in a small area. Also, compost provides the nutrition to the plants to provide a good harvest.\nNo dig around trees To help the development of the apple tree’s roots, Charles applied his nO Dig technique around apple trees.\nBefore, it will look like the picture below, with a narrower.\nAfter, the No Dig strip, covered with compost, allows to plant flowers and even vegetables.\nAs Charles tells us often, you don’t need to wait much before planting.\nNo Dig loosens the soil With the No Dig method and using compost, the soil is already loose.\nHow? With all the dead weed roots left in the soil, you find out that air is present and the compost in coming feed the life thriving. Your vegetables therefore benefit from all that.\nIn the scenario that Charles showcased in the vlog, I’d say he uses about 2 to 3 cm of compost on top of the usual cardboard.\nWhen it comes to grow a lot more vegetables, you will need more compost indeed. However, because you need less ground to grow your vegetables, you will need less compost.\nMy plan I’m planning to purchase about a ton of green compost to go further into the No Dig method.\nHowever, I’ll need to pay 26 euros per ton, but transportation and accessibility to my property require that I rent a truck for 75 euros for half a day…\nOne ton of that compost will equal to 2000 liters. The equivalent surface area represents 20 m² with a 10 cm layer of compost. It feels like nothing, but a bed of 2 meters by 10 meters provides a lot of places to grow vegetables.\nThen remember that the vegetables you grow will produce waste that you can compost to make your own compost.\n","date":"2022-11-08T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-08-no-dig--using-less-compost-to-grow-great-plants-and-have-clean-soil-charles-dowding-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/no-dig-less-compost-great-plants-clean-soil-charles-dowding/","title":"No dig: less compost to grow great plants, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"In this vlog, Charles explains how to start No Dig.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nDefinition of mulch Mulch can be anything that covers the surface you apply it to keep the light out.\nWhere to start the No Dig bed A very weedy area, a lawn are good candidates for a no dig bed.\nWhat do you need You will need:\ncardboard, because it’s the cheapest covering material wool compost If you don’t have any weed, you’re rare lucky person. Most of us will start from a weedy patch of land.\nIn the following notes, we will see how Charles will free us so much time in our gardening.\nWeeding bores and tires you and all the time used to weed isn’t the time to grow strong and healthy vegetables.\nAnd Charles’s method leaves the soil undisturbed, which is essential for a life-rich soil.\nThe weeds aren’t pulled, they stay there and eventually, they give up growing.\nCharles put it nicely: if you try to dig out the weed, they will be hurt but they will have the will to grow more and you will harm your soil.\nAbout the cardboard You can find it easily for free. But:\nuse a brown cardboard, not the shiny ones that contain plastic remove the tape and staples, if any avoid cardboard with ink, unless you’re sure it’s vegetable-based ink. How to build a No Dig bed The first application You will need to delimit your bed area and the pathways.\nThen apply a layer of cardboard over it, making sure no gap exists that will let the weeds through. Indeed, the weeds will find their way if you’re wary about the cardboard position.\nIt’s important to make sure the cardboard overlap generously to prevent light to reach the craving weeds underneath.\nWhat compost to use Fresh manure isn’t recommended. Even well-rotted cow manure doesn’t perform as well as his homemade compost, Charles finds.\nRemember the goal is to be able to sow in straight away.\nYou can use:\nGreen waste compost: it comes from general garden waste, debris, prunings, etc. This compost usually has a darker color and its performance isn’t quite as good as homemade compost Homemade compost: it comes from general garden waste, fibers, prunings, wood, etc. It doesn’t look as fine as the green waste compost. Also, you don’t need to sift it. Mushroom compost: it needs to be well decomposed. Charles didn’t say much about how it’s made, so I ask in the vlog’s comments section. Spread a 10 cm layer of compost on top of the cardboard.\nDon’t hesitate to firm the compost with your feet. It does need firmness, not loose nor compact. But the great thing about compost is that it’s never compact.\nTo contain the compost in the bedding area, you can use wood framing.\nThe issue that can arise is getting hold of a lot of compost. It’s difficult, but read in my other notes I took from Charles’s videos on the topic of compost.\nYou will need to hunt for the materials in your neighborhood. It will surprise you how much waste people will be delighted to give away for free.\nPathways around the beds The easiest and cheapest way to do it’s to use woodchips, decomposed or not, it will feed the soil life.\nThey will dig for you but in a much more gentle manner, keeping the carbon dioxide in the ground, whereas when you dig, you release carbon dioxide…\nMaintain an edge An edge is anything that covers about 20 cm extra more space than your bed is taking.\nIt will help to keep the grass to jump the rich soil of your bed.\nYou can use small wood beams and cardboard as shown below.\nYou need up to three or four cardboard applications When the weeds start to grow through the first layer of cardboard on the pathways, it’s time to pull the weeds, if it’s easy, and apply another layer of cardboard.\nAlways make sure to overlap the piece of cardboard.\nYou will need to apply each layer about every six weeks unless the weeds have died.\nTire the weeds by removing the small shoots It’s possible to remove all weeds with time and patience.\nPatrol around the garden where you put the cardboard, pull out the young shoots of weeds and the parent root will die at one point.\nIt can take a few years, however, to tire some of the strongest weeds like the bindweeds.\nIt’s achievable and you need to be patient.\nUsing soil on a new bed Charles doesn’t use soil when he builds a new bed because vegetables grow much better in compost.\nUse propagation to give the best start to seedlings Charles recommends not to sow directly in the ground because it’s vulnerable.\nPropagation means sowing the seed or multi-sown seeds in a module until the seedling is big enough to be transplanted.\nCharles has severable vlogs on the topics, check out the propagation tag. These notes are a good starting point from a more recent vlog.\nPlanting in a No Dig bed Planting is simple since the compost is easy to dig into using two fingers.\nThe demonstration (available at minute 20:50 in the vlog) above showcases how simple it is, requiring no tools.\nAbout spacing, Charles suggests 30 cm between each plant for beetroots. I’ve come across many vlogs so far on spacing. But I will certainly do, check out the tags when you read this, I may have a tag Spacing seedlings or something similar.\nAlso, remember that you will be able to do succession planting:\nplanting lettuce after the peas, planting beetroots after the spring onions etc. A comment about a few vegetables Root vegetables transplant well, unlike you may have heard.\nAgain, where does this belief come from? Is it because of the dig method not working well showing? Isn\u0026rsquo;t the problem in the action of transplanting but rather because of the method used to grow the vegetables?\nAlso, birds tend to eat broccoli, so you’ll need to protect them with nets.\nKale is a great vegetable, to be sown in May and transplanted in June. It will give you food in the winter months and even early spring.\nConclusion Keep thinking ahead, have seedlings ready for the months to come, even if it’s winter.\nYou want to keep eating from your garden all year long ultimately.\nYou will need to start small, though. I took notes on the topic in a vlog by Huw Richards. He explains the simple way to becoming self-sufficient in food. Have a read.\nThink about the storage of your vegetables. Garlic and onions harvested in the summer will stay indoors.\nFinally, eating home-grown produce is also great for you because it contains a lot of microbes very beneficial to your digestive track.\nRead the work of immunologist Dr. Jenna Macciochi.\n","date":"2022-11-07T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-07-a-basket-of-vegetables.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/starting-no-dig-with-cardboard-and-compost-charles-dowding/","title":"Start Out No Dig, a method with cardboard and compost, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"No dig, is great for growing wonderful healthy plants, giving lots of growth and a high efficiency of output per time invested.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!

You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth spending time making some decent compost because it has a multiplier effect all the way along down the line.\nHeap location It\u0026rsquo;s very convenient when you\u0026rsquo;ve got your heat reasonably central, because then it\u0026rsquo;s less time needed for bringing stuff to the beds.\nIn No Dig gardening, it is the main input of time: applying the compost.\nWhat makes great compost First, you\u0026rsquo;ve probably noticed some heat in your compost: it is the batteria at work, especially when you have got a lot of green in.\nSecond, the fungis are important as well. They don\u0026rsquo;t like it too hot, hence, not going above 70 °C is important to them alive.\nThird, a good balance of green materials and brown materials added in the heap in layers to help the decomposition to happen.\nDepending on your location and weather, you will want to avoid the heap to be under the rain, if you receive as much rain as Charles.\nCovering the heap will be necessary then.\nAlso, putting in fibery materials like stems, paper or cardboard will help to bring some air after mixing it in the heap.\nWhen is it ready Well, that depends on your condition and the following checklist:\nis it still warm? has it been turned? has it been decomposing for 6 months at least? is there any worm? Then you can go ahead.\nAlso, it will depend on how much heat you were able to have. The more you heat the compost (staying under 70 °C for the fungal activity), the fastest the compost will be ready to use.\n","date":"2022-11-06T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-06-making-compost-charles-explains-his-7-heaps-2019-charles-dowding-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/making-compost-in-7-heaps-in-2019-charles-dowding/","title":"Making compost in 7 heaps in 2019, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Successful compost can be summarized by a good a good balance of green or brown. Let\u0026rsquo;s review the must-know with Charles.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nIt’s difficult to look at it too scientifically about it and the quantity of the materials one is adding vary all the time.\nNo two gardens are the same. So the materials you will have won’t be the same as Charles or I add.\nThat’ll be perhaps broadly similar but you will always find subtle differences. So don’t worry too much about being precise.\nRatio of green and brown The mix of green and brown should be at least half green and half brown. But what is green and what is brown?\nComment about carbon to nitrogen balance It’s often talked about in books. And it confuses things because the proportion given is two parts of carbon to one part of nitrogen. So it’s more a ratio of 33% green to 66% of brown. Very few things are pure green and similarly to brown material.\nDefinition of green What is mostly green? Here is a sample list:\nAll fresh leaves Vegetable peels Kitchen waste Weed leaves Young tree leaves Fresh manure Coffee grounds Urine Definition of brown What is mostly brown? Here is a sample list:\nWoody materials Old stems Prunings Dry tree leaves Soil (in small quantity) Wood ash Paper Cardboard What is OK to put diseases material on the compost heap It’s OK to put on vegetable leaves with mildew, for example. For Charles, it doesn’t cause a problem to the finished product. He has used blighted potatoes leaves, rust of garlic or leeks and all went in the heap. For the case of blight, the disease needs living tissues and when the waste green of the plant goes on the heap, the disease will no longer persist.\nFilling the heap You can put seed on the heap, but put it in the middle where you get the most heat, warranting to kill the seeds. You can put on thistle in as well. A lot of myths, generally accepted, exist about what can\u0026rsquo;t and what can be put in the heap.\nOnce they’ve been repeated enough, then they start to enter the general belief.\nBuilding in layers Why should you fill your heap in layers? To get an even spread. We don’t see very clearly the brown layers, but it’s there in the ratio stated above. We can see a lot of vegetable stems that contain more brown than green leaves. Also depending on seasons, you will have available a various amounts of green and brown. Spring is the height of the green season. Summer is a bit more balanced green and brown And then autumn is more brown material and finally winter is very brown. So you’ve got different seasons, you have different materials.\nWhy build a heap at all A heap will hold the materials, it will hold the heat and it will make it tidier. Also, Charles has a lot of solids and it’s often said that a compost heat should have slated sides to allow some passenger in (insects, small animals, etc.). Air is a vital ingredient in compost making because that is what bacteria breathe on to live and multiply. And they do a lot of the breakdown: they’re what brings the heat in the heap. The brown material, especially larger pieces, will allow to have more air in the heap, helping the battery to do their job. You would ask: why use solid sides to build a heap? Charles explains that it helps:\nretain the heat and moisture better slatted sides don’t allow a worthwhile amount of air in. They are lined inside with cardboard, so no air enters, moisture and warmth are retained as explained in this vlog. Store brown Expand Down During spring and summer, you have less brown available. So store away leaves, for example. I’m currently _harvesting dead leaves, literally all I can get in my neighborhood. I will probably build some kind of heap just for the leaves so I can _sprinkle them into my compost in the making.\nPoint about weed roots Bindweeds are big trouble for the gardeners. I know I have got a lot. Charles isn’t afraid to say that putting in even the roots in the heap is OK. And these roots aren’t indestructible. We give them too much credit. They seem invincible, but they’re not A weed root has only so much energy, so if you can keep it away from the light while it’ll try to grow, it’ll do so or it gets too hot and die from that. And as it tries to grow, it’s using up its energy and it withers at the end. Of course, don’t just put a lot on the heap and leave them to grow. So:\ncover them put them in the middle of the heap and heat will take care of them It’s the same for couch grass, perennial thistles. Sizing your heap If you’re like Charles, you could replicate on 1.5 m by 1.5 m heap structure, but you will need 3000 m² of land with a sizable vegetable garden and the lawn and edges. Otherwise, you need to find out your size by starting small. I don’t have a large garden nor access to lots of material. I would suggest to start with Charles’s pallets heap structure that are cheaper to make and smaller. And even if it’s still too big, cut pallets in half. That’s what I’m doing.\nFinding material if you can’t produce enough Like I said above, I personally harvest dead leaves. This year, I will try to harvest all I can. Use your vegetable waste, which supposes that you eat fresh food, not prepared meals… My family throws away 5 liters each day! And actually, it’s really difficult to get material sometimes unless you get very good at scrounging. So ask your neighbors. Put the words out around you! You might be surprised.\nAbout temperature Buy one of these thermometers in France, in the UK or in the US to measure the heat. You can make compost without heat, like leaf mold. Heat is just speeding up the process of decomposition. You should also watch the heat so it doesn’t go too much over 70 °C. Over that, you will use fungal activities. If you get over 70 °C, it usually happens as a flash of heat after adding new green material.\nWhat about watering It doesn’t apply to what Charles has put on the heap in this vlog, which was mostly green. Also, too much moisture removes air from the materials and bacteria can’t live in it. You need water if it’s quite dry or if you have got a lot of brown. But in Charles’s case, where he lives, it’s quite wet all year long, so the quality of his compost has increased from the roof over his heap.\nMaintaining your heap First, write when you start it. Also, when is it good to stop filling it? Well, as long as the levels keep lowering fast, you can keep filling it. You will notice very easily when it’s slowing. Next, you don’t need to turn often your compost, despite what you have heard. You always can, but it takes time to do so and isn’t it better to use this time to gather materials instead? Charles performs only one turning.

Here, they exchange on their challenges, their success and how growing vegetables in different atmospheres really look like.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nPresentation Wini Walbaum She’s from Santiago, Chile, living with her family of four.\nThey’re trying to produce and eat as much as they can from their garden.\nAnd she teaches about growing food sustainably and with no dig on Instagram, YouTube and in online classes.\nCharles Dowding Charles runs a market garden on 1000 m² that supplies the local town.\nAt the time of the vlog, he’s talking about expanding the area cultivated.\nHe has been practicing no dig for 40 years.\nClimates Homeacres is wet while Wini leaves in a region that is a Mediterranean climate (very dry).\nYet, No Dig provides them both what they need.\nWini’s climate In Chile, it’s essential to keep the water in the ground, to retain moisture and spend less water. Wini has found out that no dig really helps to achieve that.\nShe has to water every day.\nCharle’s climate On the contrary, Charles is trying to make sure the rain is draining. He receives 90 mm of rain every month.\nYet, because of No Dig, he needs not to worry about muddy bouts. The compost (for the garden) and woodchips (for the alleys) allow to have a clean soil.\nInteresting fact\nCharles has snow at one point and as the snow was melting, one bed retained the snow. It was a dig bed!\nIt’s saying that No Dig is keeping some warmth in the soil.\nWho inspired Charles Before Homeacres, Charles started with a 6000 m² garden that he worked a tractor and rotavotor to chop weeds and the soil.\nManually, he would then make beds for 3 months.\nBut he told himself:\nWait a minute, I don’t want to keep doing that.\nSo he started researching and someone told him about a book from Ruth Stout\nShe taught about mulching with hay and Charles tried that.\nUnfortunately, slugs ate all the lettuces then… Why? Because in Charles’s climate, the hay hides the slugs that then eat the vegetables.\nCharles realized that he needed to modify her approach and he started using compost.\nVery interestingly, Wini found her inspiration through Charles and in her research, she came back to Ruth Stout!\nLessons from Ruth Stout She rejected the conventional wisdom in regard to gardening and taught to try, see how it works and adjust.\nIn 1948, on her first no dig bed, she was waiting for the plow to come. But it never came.\nSo she mulches with hay and it worked.\nTree and garden With their roots, trees are draining the water because the root breaks down the soil so it’s then less moist.\nPersonal note\nAs they said and I agree, it would depend on your situation.\nMy garden contains a lot of clay, so having small oaks, an almond tree and plants like comfrey or borage will loosen the soil, which is good for the vegetable I grow.\nVisit of Wini’s garden What the garden produces is eaten and stored if it can’t be eaten right away. Wini does very little resale.\nShe grows the usual vegetables, but also she tries out other things because of her curiosity and to help her children like what they eat.\nOriginal garden area became wild In the original garden area, she has the perennial plants and the volunteer plants (even carrots, potatoes). And she doesn’t work the soil, she only waters it.\nThe same area is also a place for flowers, bringing pollinators. It’s now untouched, going back its wild state.\nThe current garden Preparing the cultivated garden is:\ncovering with cardboard at the bottom of the beds setting up a wood frame for a raised bed applying compost and mulch She can grow all year long.\nIn the fall, and because of her climate, they’re preparing for the Brassicaceae family (cabbages, kale, broccoli, etc.).\nShe applies a new layer of compost and mulch on top of the previous one.\nIn the pathways, they have weeds that they mow.\nLessons from raised beds Deeper beds mean better water retention.\nOn a shallow bed (about 10 cm in depth), the compost dry very fast, even with heavy mulching.\nMulching technique She uses hay heavily. Without it, the first 4 to 5 cm of compost will dry out and will fly with the wind.\nPersonal note\nLiving in Ardèche has a similar climate to Wini, so I do use a lot of dead leaves that I gather in the fall and cover the ground with a 20 cm deep layer.\nIt’s the blanket of the winter.\nThe downside of mulching is that bugs will live under it.\nPest control Some bugs will eat your seedlings. Wini’s ingenious solution is to make stronger and more resilient seedlings that the bugs around her area won’t find attractive.\nOlder plants work best for her.\nPlanting She does plan vegetables very close to each other, because it will help, from the foliage, to keep the moisture as well.\nI do have the same observation in my garden.\nHomeacre new area It will be a lot about teaching and learning, more than producing crops to resale on the market.\nThe first year is the hardest year.\nDigging this new area would require a lot of energy because of the abundance of clay.\nBe happy with clay\nNo Dig works really well with clay.\nWhy?\nit retains moisture it provides fertility it doesn’t stick to boots anymore it builds a soil that has a good balance of drainage and moisture. Weeding efficiently You will need patience. But eventually, with No Dig, you can vanquish the toughest weeds.\nWhy? In facts, covering the ground with cardboard and compost is already keeping the weeds at bay. But also, apply a plastic sheet on top for a month or two will deplete the weed roots.\nHowever, you might need to perform some follow-up work to root out the remaining weeds.\nAdvantages of No Dig First, and let’s repeat it, compost doesn’t burn the roots. Hot compost is what burns the roots. It’s more about waiting for the\nThen, with a starting bed, you have 10 cm of compost, in which the plants will grow until they reach the soil.\nAnd the soil has a lot of growing space, free from weeds.\nAlso, while covered with the plastic sheet and waiting for the weeds to die, the soil life processed the compost.\nFinally, it\u0026rsquo;s very quick to prepare.\nStructure of the soil It doesn’t need to be loose and fluffy. That’s what the rotavotor sellers want us to believe.\nSoil needs to be firm but loose enough to help the roots of vegetables to go down.\nFirm is better than compact.\n","date":"2022-11-01T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-11-01-wini-walbaum-charles-dowding--no-dig--straw-hay-for-dry-climate--compost.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-11/wini-walbaum-and-charles-dowding-share-no-dig-charles-dowding/","title":"Wini Walbaum \u0026 Charles Dowding  no dig, straw-hay for dry climate, compost for damp one, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Gardening is full of conflicting advice.

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nMildew Charles shares that in his experience, it isn’t the end of the world.\nIt’s more a sequence of events where the plants are losing their older leaves.\nLeaves can turn yellow all summer and it’s possible it isn’t a problem.\nFor example, the uchiki kuri squash won’t do well in a soil with a little bit of gravel.\nPlants know how much they produce It will happen, and I have indeed experienced this in the past, that you will see many fruits on a squash plant appearing, and some will grow to maturation and some will root in the early stage.\nThat’s fine and you shouldn’t worry much about it.\nGrowing squash on a compost heap doesn’t deplete the nutrients Remember: compost is about biological activation of what is already in the soil.\nCompost doesn’t burn the roots It isn’t true.\nIt’s true when the compost heap itself is still very hot.\nA hot compost means the early decomposition process is still going on and the plant won’t find enough goodness to grow well.\nRoot vegetables lessons It has been said so often that big root vegetables go woody.\nIt’s absolutely not true.\nMaybe, if it tastes woody, it’s more to do with a poor soil?\nInteresting fact\nWhen you cut open a fresh beetroot, you should see some rings, one for every moon cycle.\nSowing Swiss chard shouldn’t happen too early to avoid bolting. Charles suggests for his location to sow charts in April.\nThe cause of charts bolting is the cold exposure if sown too early.\nAlso, regarding seedlings, don’t hold them for too long because their quality will decrease.\nWhat yellow leaves tell us It’s indicating a low nitrogen level.\nDon’t blame yourself, learn from experience Sometimes, a plant won’t grow for some reason.\nBlaming yourself is then counterproductive.

It’s a good indicator that your compost nears readiness.\nYou never see them before the temperature in low enough for them to settle in.\nDo you need solid sides on your heap Solid seem to work best, according to Charles’s experience.\nWhat wood Charles uses Douglas wood planks, thick enough to hold the pretty big heaps.\nDo the heaps need to be in the sun or shade It doesn’t matter at all, as the heat comes from the breaking down of the material in the heap.\nIt isn’t the sun that will make your compost hot.\nThe roof on Charles’s large heaps is to keep the rain off.\nWhy? To make compost, you need air. If the compost is too soggy, no or little air is present in the heap and that will prevent the battery and the life in the compost to do their work.\nHow often should I turn my compost heap Turning isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily done often. It will help giving the heap some air.\nCharles turns it once.\nHis heaps make it easy to transfer the content of a first heap into its neighbor.\nCharles has a mobile divider between the heap so he can transfer the content easily.\nDo you need to layer the content of the heap Layering helps to make it easier to have a good balance of green and brown material (the 1/3 brown to 2/3 green ratio).\nCan you put on weed root Yes, you can.\nWhat about rats They will like the warmth of the heap, and Charles isn’t overrun by rats so he can’t give much advice about it.\nMaybe it’s because cats or wildlife like weasel eat the rats (see a filmed attack at Homeacres at 8:23).\nIt tells us that the ecosystem of the garden isn’t just vegetables and flowers.\nConclusion The presentation of Charles’s method is showing us that the goal is to impact the least natural processes.\nWith the heap, we just accelerate the decomposition in balance with the nature around us.\n","date":"2022-10-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-30-compost-making-qa-charles-dowding-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/compost-making-qa-charles-dowding/","title":"Compost Making Q\u0026A, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Charles presents quick ways to make and use compost in a no dig garden.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!

I have been watching Charles’s vlogs for a while and tested myself the ideas he shares and I can tell you it is true.\nCharles explains that the bindweed loses the contact with the parent root in the heap. Within a month or two, the pulled-out roots loose the resources to develop and they die, even a cool heap.\nAbout weed seeds\nYou must have heat to kill seeds, between 60 °C to 70 °C. Otherwise, they grow once you spread the compost in the beds.\nBut because they are on the top, it is easy to root them out again. But do it early!\nA few tips about the garden Keep a clean area, to reduce the number of slugs or snails. Leave vegetable roots in the soil after harvest How to assemble the pallets for your heap The steps are:\nClean up the area, removing roots of any kind Take 4 wood pallets Take off, or not depending on your preference, the bottoms Attach the sides together with a wire on top and bottom (and even in the middle if necessary) Put cardboard around the inside edges to keep the light out and the moisture as you will fill in the heap. That is it!\nNo need of wood post to hold the pallets up.\nNo need of cardboard at the bottom.\nHow to use the 3-heap system You will fill heap 1 first. Then you will fill heap 2. Then, when the heap 1 has sunk by half, you turn the content into heap 3. You do the same with heap 2 into heap 3 when it is ready. When you need to turn heap 1 into heap 3 again, your compost in heap 3 from the first cycle is ready.\nWhat do you put in the heap You can put:\nblighted tomato and potatoes leaves, stems and fruits (because blight can’t survive in the compost heap) green vegetable waste weeds without the soil (because it will help the weed develop…) Charles suggests to do the following to hold the structure in the heap:\n5 cm of green a thin layer of brown (autumn leaves, for example) Within about 6 to 10 months, the compost will be ready.

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nWe will look in this article how Charles suggests how to start no dig in your garden.\nStarting from weeds You can use cardboard, then you apply a layer of compost, and you are done.\nIf you have no weeds, it will not be necessary to use cardboard. But who doesn’t have weeds? ;)\nThen, you can plant straight away.\nYes, it is OK to plan in compost\nHow big should your new no dig bed(s) be No matter the size, it will be the same area.\nBut maybe start a smaller area.\nPreparing the area Before you start with the bed, it is a good idea to cover the chosen area with black polythene cover (that you can reuse multiple times).\nIt will serve to weaken the weeds.\nDo it a month before the actual bed making.\nThe key is to keep the light away from the weeds. It will kill the plant’s roots.\nAlso, it is a method that doesn’t disturb the soil. The structure of the soil is important to keep, because we don\u0026rsquo;t see all that is going on in it. It is a very complex system.\nAnd the life will thrive in such a soil!\nNotes about light and shade Shade is OK, and leafy crops will do OK compared to crops really needing the sun light (tomatoes for example).\nIf you have leaf-dense trees, maybe pruning them to produce less shade is better than cutting the tree down.\nPersonal note\nWith a tree, you will have roots and depending on the crops, it can affect the growth.\nBut most importantly, the fungal activity that a tree brings is positive for the soil quality.\nSo think well before cutting a tree down\nSoil on uneven ground Before applying the compost, you can cover the portions of the select area that are uneven with soil.\nWhy soil rather than compost? It is because of the density of soil which will hold better on the long run. Meanwhile, the compost will shrink and the uneven ground will appear again.\nWhat about weed roots in the soil?\nYou can find weed roots like, bindweeds, dandelions, buttercup and more.\nBindweeds might not die in the soil, dandelions and creeping buttercup will.\nSo fish out the bindweed roots!\nDifferents compost Homemade compost Charles’s homemade compost is rough and not the perfect compost, but it is quite woody and that helps to keep a good fungal activity, good for plants.\nThe composition is green waste, cardboard, mowing waste and woodchips.\nIt is good for almost any crop.\nHorse manure If it contains worms, decomposition is still ongoing. And it is fine to use compost for horse manure in such a state for the no dig beds.\nCow manure It can be dry after a while.\nWoodchips It will require a lot more time to decompose.\nCharles’s warning\nThe best way to use the compost made from woodchips is to put it on top.\nWhy? Because large pieces of wood not yet decomposed can take the nitrogen out of the soil.\nHowever, it is a fantastic mulch for pathways. Just put cardboard first. It will feed the soil and that is beneficial.\nGreen waste compost It is not the perfect compost, but it can be easily found for little money.\nIt comes from the decomposition of the wastes at hot temperatures.\nIt is very dark and it is a good idea to let it sit a while to give it some activities (soil life) and remember, fish out the bindweed!\nCommercial potting compost It is not to use solely to cover the area chosen, but more for potting or applying a thin layer on top of another compost.\nInformation about cardboard Choosing cardboard remove any tape don’t shiny cardboard use brown cardboard If cardboard has printing on, it is usually fine if it is vegetable-based inks. It depends on the shop. The rule is: the less ink, the better.\nApplying cardboard Try to overlap the cardboard piece like shown below.\nOtherwise, to have a clean edge, you can add cardboard under to keep the light from feeding the weeds.\nWood piece to mark the bed. It is not required, but it can help to set wood pieces around the bed to hold or to form the bed.\nOnce the bed is settled, you can remove it.\nDo you need to wet the cardboard\nYes, if you will apply the compost in a dry region, especially in summer time.\nNo, if you are getting a good amount of rain or rain often, like the UK for Charles.\nApplying the compost See the vlog at 17:35 for the demo.\nCharles just pours the buckets of compost one at a time, breaking any bulk pieces.\nDon’t puncture the cardboard!\nAt this stage, you don’t want to puncture the cardboard so the weeds can’t grow up.\nYou can plant anything now, because by the time the plant’s roots reach the cardboard, it will be soft enough to allow the plant to reach further down.\nIf you want to plant straight away, with a lot of weeds, apply about a 10 cm layer of compost.\nTo be continued about Charles’s No Dig method…\n","date":"2022-10-26T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-26-a-man-cleaning-a-lettuce.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/how-to-start-a-no-dig-bed-charles-dowding/","title":"How to Start a No Dig Bed and Compost Differences, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Composting can be achieved in various heaps or compost bins.

They are tiger worms which eggs are the materials put in to make the compost and they are helping the composting process.\nHowever, Charles starts using compost after 7 months as the decomposition will continue on the soil.\nSifting compost Charles only uses the 4 mm sifting tray to prepare potting compost and he only uses it for potting plants.\nHow much compost and when to spread it Charles covers the garden areas with 2.5 cm once a year only, anytime of the year.\nTo make a bed, you will, of course, need a bigger depth to start off.\nAnother kind of heap You can build them out of pallets with their bottom stripped off, to make the side much lighter.\nEach side is attached to the two connecting other sides with a simple wire at the top and the bottom.\nThe heaps sit on the ground, not tied to anything.\nInside, you can use cardboard to keep the moisture (when it is very dry in summer for example).\nYou can throw simply everything.\nWeed root can decompose without heat since you keep adding material on top of them.\nA lot can go in, such as:\nvegetable waste banana skin lemon peel cardboard waste, as long as it contains no plastic For more woody or harder material, like the cauliflower stem below, you should cut it in smaller pieces.\nCharles shows below how to cut the stem in the length, which is much easier.\nAdding woody material is really good to bring more fungal activities, which then helps break down the materials.\nLife in the heaps Wildlife, like mice, toads, frogs, will be found in the heaps.\nAlso, worms will multiply and work hard to decompose the compost more and more.\nWoodchip composting It is much harder to decompose woodchips. Charles did another vlog about a solution. Use the tag woodchip to find the notes I will have taken in the near future.\nWorm farm Charles has a slow worm (Anguis fragilis) in a worm farm.\nApparently, it eats slugs!\nCharles bought 4 kg of worms but it is necessary.\nWorm compost is really good for potting.\nGo read the notes I took from the trials Charles did that showed how worm compost in the proper amount helped:\nCompost Testing and Final Result Comparing different composts for propagation ","date":"2022-10-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-25-compost-thermometer-measuring-temperature-in-a-heap.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/composting-results-from-varied-sizes-of-heap-charles-dowding/","title":"Compost making and results from varied sizes of heap, with Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Charles has come to an end with his compost comparaison. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the results and the conclusion to draw from it.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nTrial setup Charles has 12 pots of different mixes of compost with spinach and spring onions.\nThere are:\nPots 1 to 3: 3 pots of 9-month-old homemade compost sifted at 4 mm\npot 1: the first pot is filled with 100% homemade compost pot 2: the second pot is filled with 25% of worm compost and 75% homemade compost pot 3: the third pot is filled with 20% worm compost, a little bit of seaweed and 80% of homemade compost Pots 4 to 6: 3 pots of 2–3 years old woodchips compost of sifted at 4 mm\npot 4: the first pot is filled with 100% woodchip compost pot 5: the second pot is filled with 30% of worm compost and 70% woodchip compost pot 6: the third pot is filled with 50% of worm compost and 50% woodchip compost Pots 7 to 9: 3 pots of Moorland Gold compost\npot 7: the first pot is filled with 100% Moorland Gold compost pot 8: the second pot is filled with 30% of woodchip compost and 70% Moorland Gold compost pot 9: the third pot is filled with 25% of worm compost and 75% Moorland Gold compost Pots 10 to 11: 2 pots of mushroom compost\npot 10: the first pot is filled with 100% mushroom compost pot 11: the second pot is filled with 25% of worm compost and 70% mushroom compost Pot 12: 25% worm compost and 75% regular soil\nPot 13: 100% regular soil\nDay 16 updates First, the pots are relatively small for the plants growing; therefore, the nutrients might run low at some stage. It will be interesting to see how the plants will handle it.\nPots 13 and 12: pure soil with worm compost The spring onion is looking better in the pot 13 compared to the pot 12, even though the latter has 25% worm compost… Still, the spinach has a darker color in the pot 12.\nPots 4 to 6: woodchip compost and co Surprisingly, pot 4 (100% woodchip compost) is doing well, even if, historically, the wood usually takes out more out of the plant. It even has the best-looking onions.\nPots 5 and 6 show a difference in the size of the spinach (larger in pot 6 and the largest so far).\nPots 10 and 11: mushroom compost Apparently, the mushroom compost isn’t very successful.\nWhy? When the mushroom compost was very young, still hot and dry. Also, the compost is holding water much more than the rest, and the roots are probably being asphyxiated…\nPots 1 to 3: homemade compost and co Again, the homemade compost, pure or with a mix of worm compost, the results are not as Charles expected.\nPots 7 to 9: Moorland Gold compost It is doing pretty well, and actually it does better with less worm compost, probably because the Moorland Gold compost is already pretty rich.\nThe spinach is the darkest one in pots 7 and 9.\nDay 30 updates The progress is producing very interesting results:\nIn pot 7 (100% Moorland Gold compost), the spinach is getting yellow, which mean the nutrients are running low.\nIn pot 9 (25% of worm compost and 75% Moorland Gold compost), the onions are much bigger\nPot 5 (30% of worm compost and 70% woodchip compost) even outperformed pot 7\nPot 12 (soil with worm compost) outperformed pot 13 (pure soil)\nComparing pot 4 (100% woodchip compost) to pot 6 (50% of worm compost and 50% woodchip compost), the former isn’t looking as brilliant as on day 16, with a spinach looking yellow while the onion is OK. However, we clearly see the benefits of added worm compost in pot 6.\nPot 5 and pot 6 are interesting to compare because, to me, it looks like 50% worm compost seems to produce a worse result than 30% worm compost\nPots 10 and 11 are giving a lesson: the plants will struggle at first, but they can come out well. Even, these pots are the best-looking spinach on day 40!\nPot 1 (100% homemade compost) is showing another lesson: homemade compost has again won with the best-looking spinach in size even if it didn’t start out well (the onion is showing the sequels…).\nCharles points out his homemade compost is not designed for potting, it doesn’t behave like the hare, but rather the tortoise :D Comparing pot 1 to pot 3 (20% worm compost, a little of seaweed and 80%% homemade compost), we see the similar results. The onion looks better because it started much better in pot 3.\nComparing pot 1 to pot 2 (25% worm compost and 75% homemade compost), we see once more the benefits from worm compost.\nLooking at the roots With soil The root system of the soil pot is very good.\nWith woodchip compost Woodchip alone is not enough, even if the pot 4 had roots. But pots 5 and 6 showed that having the nutrients of the worm compost made the plants healthier.\nWith worm compost Limiting the worm compost is important, as we see that too much will hurt the roots.\nSee below pot 6:\nWhy? Because the drainage is not the best, so avoiding it at 100% (despite the price tag) is a good idea.\nWith Mushroom compost The roots are pretty nice, even though at the start, the lack of good drainage slow down the growth.\nWith homemade compost The roots are the healthiest of all. It shows that the homemade compost brings a nice balance of nutrients and structure (with various sizes of particles, small and bigger).\nConclusion Worm compost, in about 20–25% proportion, can boost your plants and give great results. Higher\nMushroom compost is showing that it would be good for potting, but let it age first. I wish I could say I can buy £50 per ton delivered for it! :O\nMoorland Gold potting compost clearly shows it is not made to be used as it was in the trial. The plants must be transplanted in the ground.\nA balance of good drainage and sufficient nutrients is the goal in the end and a slight variation will affect the root system and the health of the plant.\nGeneral notes Do we need to add anything for drainage in the mix to grow vegetables? We are talking about vermiculite or feeds or amendments.\nCharles rarely uses vermiculite: only for lettuce and basil.\nWhen you are making seedlings, starting from a seed, it could make a difference. But at the stage of growth of the picture below, it won’t.\nAlso, when the plant is big enough, having more drainage with wash away the nutrients.\nCompost is brilliant to retain nutrients.\n","date":"2022-10-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-23-compost-testing-and-final-result-charles-dowding-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/compost-testing-and-final-result-charles-dowding/","title":"Compost Testing and Final Result, with Charles Dowding"},{"content":"What happened in the garden in 2022? We had a lot of volunteer crops, more badgers and a very dry year overall\u0026hellip;\nEven if I didn\u0026rsquo;t spend a lot of time planting, there were tasks to do in the garden!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s review all of that.\nPumpkins Only volunteer crops grew up this year, all from last year compost area, where we put lots of autumn leaves and kitchen waste.\nThe plants grew very well, spreading along the fence and even up the oak tree. We had a couple of lanterns in the tree, as you see above ;)\nThe harvest was better than 2020 (when we had picked 12.274 kg). This year, we reached 17.686 kg without any planting work.\nAnd the pumpkins were very tasty so far. You can guess we won\u0026rsquo;t have much left before the winter.\nPotatoes A lot of volunteer crops came up this year. We planted a few in the spring.\nWe harvested 1150 grams only.\nLemon wort (Lemon verbena) We harvested 3 times the lemon wort and we washed and dried it immediately using the solar-powered dehydrator.\nI think we could have had one more if I harvested the stems earlier in June.\nThe quantity harvested, however, is enough for a year’s worth of herbal infusions.\nKiwai (Actinidia arguta) This year, the spring was mild and no frost hit the flowers of our kiwai vine.\nThe vine produced 220 g of fruits.\nI hope next year will bring more. The vine has grown a little more.\nWe’re planning to buy another one to plant in the next available area for gardening.\nKiwai are high in Vitamin C, even more than the regular kiwi fruit. I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a technical source, though, only a few web pages stating that fact.\nRaspberries It was a surprise when I saw over a dozen raspberries stems shoot out from the ground in spring. The winter blanket of dead leaves has probably helped.\nThe stems grew tall, but we had few fruits, just enough to eat on the spot.\nThe dry summer burnt almost of them.\nThe autumn water and nice weather, however, brought them back to life!\nBlack currants We planted three plants this year and it produces a few fruits.\nBut like the rest, the lack of water almost killed them. However, the rain of late August brought hope and new leaves bloomed.\nWe can\u0026rsquo;t wait for the plants to grow so we can have fruits and make tincture from the blossom.\nComfrey The comfrey was strong again this year.\nTo do Add a picture\nLike all the rest, the very dry summer didn\u0026rsquo;t spare the plant, but the very mild autumn so far has helped new leaves to grow.\nI transplanted four young comfrey plants near the current compost area. So nice to be able to start reproduction.\nDandelions To do Add a picture\nWe had very nice and big dandelions instead of the rocket salad (that has died, I think, after 2 years of crops from the same plants). The leaves were large and lasted a few meals in the spring.\nThe roots are still there, so they will be back next spring.\nNettles To do Add a picture\nThey’re spreading well. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t excite everyone in the family, but the roots are superficial and the top soil rather soft. So it’s easy to move the roots around.\nI will probably more of them to the next composting area.\nI need to nettles for all sorts of reason: as a natural fertilizer, as food in soup or herbal infusion or even tinctures.\nTomatoes I purchased four tomato plants. But it wasn\u0026rsquo;t the year for them.\nI only picked a few black cherry tomatoes and a nice pineapple tomato.\nI think they lacked water in the summer, near the end of July and the beginning of August, when we weren’t there.\nEven if I put in the place the irrigation, the plants had dried up when we came back. What didn\u0026rsquo;t get eaten by the sheep, who made their way in the garden due to my negligence, was pretty weak\u0026hellip;\nWe didn\u0026rsquo;t miss the tomatoes. We didn\u0026rsquo;t eat that much, even from our purchases in the local grocery store.\nCover crops with flax-seed and green lentils On August 12, 2022, I sowed some in different places after preparing the places with bought compost.\nThen I threw the seeds by hand and recovered with soil from an old raised bed.\nOn August 17, 2022, I covered the sprouting seeds with hay to keep the moisture.\nThe lentils growed well. The goal was to enrich the soil with the green waste, but, more importantly, with the nitrogen stored by the lentils.\nOn August 28, 2022, this is how the lentils looked like:\nBadgers OK, those beasts have been generating trouble for two years now\u0026hellip;\nThey’re probably looking for food, and they come to the garden to plow the ground, not matter what we planted in it.\nLast year, the peas had to be replanted three times!\nSo this year, I\u0026rsquo;ve planted almost nothing because I didn\u0026rsquo;t take time to find a solution to repel them.\nOnly in September, I installed a rabbit fencing where I think the badgers are coming through. We have fenced all around the garden because of the sheep, but the badgers found a hole big enough to sneak in.\nIt remains to be seen if I did patch all the holes in the fence\u0026hellip;\nNext year\u0026rsquo;s plan I would love to plant more, to start to grow more vegetables to reach some partial autonomy.\nI plan\nto start planting:\ngarlic (from heads purchased at our organic grocery shop), board bean (Vicia faba L.) to eat but mainly to capture the nitrogen in the air then to continue with all I can plant, from lettuce, to spinach, round carrots and beets.\nHowever, the main job is to bring better soil, maybe even purchase a large amount of compost. It’s supposed to cost 115.5 euros for about one ton of 20 mm organic-compatible compost. 75% of the cost goes into transport (renting a truck).\nTo be continued\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2022-10-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-24-inside-a-kiwai.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/gardening-in-2022/","title":"Gardening in 2022: observations, harvest and next year's plans"},{"content":"When do you spread compost? How much do you spread? The guidelines explained by Charles in a No Dig approach.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding’s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nWe will look into the misunderstandings and questions about compost and spreading it.\nWhat is the best time to spread compost This question leads to the misunderstanding that nutrients leach out of compost. They don\u0026rsquo;t.\nCompost isn\u0026rsquo;t fertilizer.\nCompost feeds soil life and helps build the mycelia threads beneficial for the soil and plants, like you can see below.\nThey make available the nutrients which sits there insoluble in water.\nYou can spread the compost in autumn to please the soil the most. And you can apply the compost around existing crops.\nHow much compost Charles put every year 2.5 cm, but it\u0026rsquo;s close to 2 cm.\nPutting the compost in the winter benefits the growth of two different crops a year.\nIt makes the gardener much easier.\nWhy the soil level barely rises Charles has been doing this for 10 years, with an initial dose of 10 cm.\nThe compost is eaten all the time, so the levels of the bed don\u0026rsquo;t rise.\nCompost isn\u0026rsquo;t soil.\nIn a 16th of acres, how much compost do you need You will need 4 cubic meters, which equals to 2.4 tons.\nCharles details that you don’t spread compost the whole area.\nFor example, the pathways can be covered with woodchips or tiles.\nIn the end, it equals to about two third of the area.\nWhat does well-rotted compost mean First, a compost doesn’t need to be perfect.\nWood pieces are for fungal life.\nWhat kind of compost You will have:\nHomemade, of about 1 year old, depending on how much woody parts you have in it.\nGreen waste, that you need to age to yield a good result.\nManure represents food for the soil, but again, try not to use it fresh or use it in a thin layer. It\u0026rsquo;s not technically compost as a fresh product, but becomes one after a year of maturation.\nWoodchips can become compost, but it will require a lot of time so the wood decomposes well. Remember, the woodchip below will look like wood after the rain washes it.\nWhen is compost ready Three-month-old compost, still steaming, isn\u0026rsquo;t ready to use.\nYou will know when the temperature isn\u0026rsquo;t high anymore. It will give you better results when using a mature compost.\nIndeed, the living organisms in the soil won’t have to perform the heavy work of breaking down the material in the compost and will focus on bringing the nutrients to the plants.\nCheckout Charles’s book (use the link according to your location: in France, in the US or in the UK) for more details about compost.\n","date":"2022-10-22T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-28-charles-dowding-shows-compost-qualities--when-to-spread--and-how-much-charles-dowding-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/compost-qualities-when-to-spread-how-much-charles-dowding/","title":"Compost: when to spread and how much, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Experimenting brings surprises.

The compost of the byproduct of digestion.\nSome gifted New Horizon compost\nWorm compost\nMethod used for the trial Charles used 15-module trays.\nI will review the vlogs from Charles about the trays later.\nIf you can wait, watch them now:\nMy new 60 cells and long life module tray New Charles Dowding module trays of 15 and 30 cells What is grown in the trial Charles is doing the trial using radish and lettuce (batavia type).\nFilling the trays Don’t be afraid to fill them pretty full, e.g., pressing the compost into the modules so it is dense.\nWhy? Because the modules are small.\nWatering The initial watering needs to make the trays fully moist.\nBut after that, you don’t need to water daily. A rule would be to water enough so the compost stays humid.\nThe seedlings will require more watering later, as the seedlings grow.\nWhen will the seedlings be ready for transplanting Radish will be ready first, about 2–3 weeks after sowing them in the trays.\nLettuce will need another week.\nWeek 1 updates Charles received some worm compost so he prepared 2 trays:\none with this worm compost one with the Yorkshire compost to be able to make a proper comparison. As for the other trays, the progress is already quite significant:\nHomemade compost\nMoorland Gold compost\nDigested compost\nNew Horizon compost\nThe take-out\nNot much difference between the Yorkshire digested and New Horizon compost The homemade compost isn’t totally successful, probably caused by too much woody material, according to Charles humble opinion. Maybe it is too young. Week 3 updates Moorland compost vs. worm compost After 11 days, the Moorland compost has a small advantage.\nBut both trays show that the radishes are ready to transplant!\nThe trial Homemade compost\nMoorland Gold compost\nDigested compost\nNew Horizon compost\nThe take-out\nThe homemade compost is caught up, but Charles is not sure what happened to the middle row of radishes, maybe some lack of water. The digested compost indeed doesn’t look to have progressed as much and the color isn’t as green as the rest. The Moorland Gold compost give out bigger seedlings, while the New Horizon shows more green plants. Week 8 updates Five weeks after transplanting in the bed, here are the results:\nThe radishes Compost Harvest (grams) Homemade 715 Moorland Gold seed 1250 Moorland Gold potting 1100 Digested 800 New Horizon 1020 For the worm compost vs. Moorland compost:\nCompost Harvest (grams) Worm 875 Moorland Gold potting 750 Here are the pictures of the harvest, compost by compost:\nHomemade compost\nMoorland Gold compost\nFor the seed compost: For the potting compost Digested compost\nNew Horizon compost\nWorm compost vs. Moorland Gold potting compost\nThe take-out\nThe worm compost shows less slug damage than the others.

Conclusion All compost did pretty well, overall.\nWe can see some differences, with some lettuces lost (not due to compost but more from the seedling used).\nAlso, remember that the soil of Charles’s garden is quite rich and fertile. I wonder how in proportion he uses his homemade compost versus the Moorland Gold he buys.\nGeneric notes When to prick lettuce seedlings into modules Usually, it should be done when it is at the 2-leaf stage.\nHow long can we use purchased compost A compost purchased is good for the year of purchased and the following, from Charles’s experience.\nSowing compost vs. potting compost The usual difference between sowing compost and potting compost is that the seed compost usually has some sand in it for better draining.\nDo you really need sowing compost for seedlings According to Charles’s experience, it doesn’t make a big difference, apart from the price\u0026hellip;\n","date":"2022-10-21T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-21-comparing-different-composts-for-propagation-charles-dowding-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/comparing-different-composts-for-propagation-charles-dowding/","title":"Comparing different composts for propagation, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Thanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!

You can just pull the onions off the soil and let them dry for a few days.\nThe onions above are drying on a pallet-like wood structure after harvesting to keep onions off the ground.\nCharles showed an onion with a flower and he suggested eating those first, but we will know more on videos dedicated to the onions, which is a big subject on its own.\nBeetroot and deer damage to leaves The deer haven\u0026rsquo;t really damaged much of the strip of beetroots.

It can affect the auxiliary insects (bees in particular) if not prepared well and sprayed at the proper time. See this French article.\nCracking soil at the edge of the bed With no dig, the soil isn\u0026rsquo;t cracking because of the structure of the soil, filled with good compost, life within the soil.\nCompost heaps, the pallet three bay system I have taken notes on this in this article\nSalads in July The above left strip is 3 weeks old and the salads look quite big!\nThe right strip has been planted about 10 days before the video shooting.\nPeas are ending The peas will turn yellow when they are finishing producing.\nThe above image is a pea that you can eat the whole pod and seeds.\nBut usually, you harvest them when they are dried like the example below.\nFrench beans and watering Charles suggests holding off the watering until the bean plants start producing crops.\nHe puts on a good dose of water every 3 days, in his area. Of course, this will vary from an area to another and it will depend on the weather too.\nCucumbers in the polytunnel You can see how the stems of the cucumber plants are well trimmed from the ground to about 2 feet up.\nThe cucumbers we see above have been sowed on April 15th.\nHowever, to get the plant size you see, it needs a lot of water.\nGrowing and seedlings in the greenhouse It seems that the tomatoes do better in terms of leaf quality in the greenhouse because of the smaller temperature difference between night and day than in a polytunnel.\nBut it does get hot (Charles had up to 38°C\u0026hellip;).\nCucumbers like the warmth, but one needs to be careful with the seedlings.\nIn regards to melons, if you grow different varieties close to each other, keeping the seeds of the fruits may not produce the same plant the next because hybridization.\nTomatoes and harvesting time Tomatoes can be harvested when the color is changing, like the ones below.\nCharles suggests watching Joe Lampl\u0026rsquo;s channel to know more about tomatoes.\nPicking your tomatoes not fully rip take some stress off the plant, which can focus the other fruits, new fruits and the leaves.\nAnd you don\u0026rsquo;t lose flavor from the tomatoes by harvesting them this way.\n","date":"2022-10-15T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-15-a-pea-pod-with-large-seeds-in-the-hands-of-charles.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/july-tour-of-homeacres-garden-charles-dowding/","title":"July tour of new no dig garden, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Compost is a key element to grow great vegetables. But how much or how little is a question that Charles Dowding will answer for us.\nThis article represents my notes from his vlog.\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Charles Dowding\u0026rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nIntroduction With no dig, you need less compost (this is from 10 years of experience).\nBut the sure thing is that you will need descent compost. And if you use a good compost, you will need very little, especially with No Dig.\nClarification of the meaning of compost When we talk about compost, we talk about organic material, not fertilizers and synthetic feeds.\nCompost is anything decomposed. It does not need to be perfect, e.g., it can have some piece of wood.\nAt first, you may need to buy some compost. But after a while, if you look after your soil, you won\u0026rsquo;t need as much and you can find materials to make your own from local waste.\nCharles explains his 3-strip trial:\nStrip 1\nIt was the strip where the soil was dug and he used no compost. Strip 2\nIt was the strip where the soil was not dug and no compost was used. Strip 3\nIt was the strip where the soil was not dug AND some compost was used (5-6 cm of well-rotted compost). On all strips were planted the same crops.\nAfter the 2013 harvest, the yields were as follows:\nStrip 1 yielded 41.2 kg of produce, Strip 2 yielded 40.6 kg of produce Strip 3 yielded 61.5 kg of produce. This is 50 % more yields: the strip 3 method is definitely interesting.\nAnd the same amount of work is performed. Watering is needed a bit less, thanks to compost.\nModification of trial and results in 2014 This time, Charles and his team applied the following trial:\nStrip 1: forked with 2-3 cm of compost each year. The soil is loosened, before applying compost . Strip 2: no dig with 2-3 cm of compost each year. Strip 3: no dig with 2-3 cm of well-rotted cow manure each year. For strips 1 and 2, the compost is green waste compost purchased combined with homemade compost.\nAnd here are the yield results in 2014 compared to 2013:\nStrip 2013 2014 1 41.2 kg 68.0 kg 2 40.6 kg 79.0 kg 3 61.5 kg 75.0 kg Progress of 2015 By that year, the yields went up to 100 kg per strip!\nEach year, the amount of compost applied is about 3 to 5 cm, spread in February.\nHow to cover the pathways\nUse well rotted woodchips.\nDigging or not digging, compost is a must. Period.\nMore on the strip trial in this vlog.\nAnother trial running since 2012 to compare dig and no dig The big differences between each bed are:\nThat the no dig bed requires a lot of less work not digging since you just need to cover the soil.\nThe dig bed is more difficult to water (water flows more).\nThe dig bed has a lot more leaves.\nIn 9 years,\nThe dig bed yielded 855 kg of produce. The no-dig bed yielded 953 kg of produce, just about 10% more. Again, here, we can take home that the use of compost makes a big difference.\nAnd it is applied once a year in the change of years.\nHere is more information about dig vs no dig methods.\nEasy sucession planting in the dig and no dig beds In such a bed, we can plant more than one set of crops.\nThe most difference between dig and no dig happens in the late spring harvest.\nOverall benefits of using compost It might feel like a lot of work in the beginning, using a wheelbarrow to bring the compost on the beds, but it is really worth it.\nUsing compost and no dig yield the best result!\nSee the beds of Charles from an aerial view:\nIf you want a big resource on the No Dig method, Checkout Charles’s book (use the link according to your location: in France, in the US or in the UK) for more details.\nAny comments?

I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards\u0026rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nWhy Even if the most common way to harvest garlic is to wait that the bottom has turned brown, there are two other types of garlic harvest:\nEarly harvest: when you harvest earlier, the garlic is much juicer and has a better flavor exchange in cooking. Green garlic: you can then enjoy garlic up twelve weeks before the usual harvest time The latter will be the focus of the following notes.\nBefore moving on, remember that late May is within that hungry gap period: it is the time of the year when you are finishing your winter crops, but the spring crops haven\u0026rsquo;t yet yielded fruits.\nDuring the hungry gap, alongside with green garlic, you can find purple broccoli and asparagus to fill the leanest period of the year.\nWhat is green garlic It is similar to a leak.\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t only eat the immature bulb but you will also eat the stem.\nWhen to harvest It really is up to you. Huw\u0026rsquo;s preference is to pick it up when it is the size of a small leak.\nBenefits of green garlic If you forget to sow garlic in the autumn, you can still sow it in the spring and get green garlic, even if you may not get a mature garlic (it is actually harder to \u0026ldquo;bulb-up\u0026rdquo; garlic when planted in spring).\nAnother benefit is to set free garden space for another crop, like shallots. Then you don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait all the way to the end of June / early July to set the new crop.\nCooking and green garlic Green garlic is more like a leak, in flavor, but sweeter.\nFor example, green garlic with potatoes gives an interesting taste, because of the sweetness of garlic when young.\nGrowing idea with closer spacing What about sowing the cloves closer, like every 5 cm instead of every 10 cm, so that, when the green garlic harvest comes, you harvest every other one to leave the other one to grow fully.\nThen in the same space, you will get both green and mature garlic.\n","date":"2022-10-03T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-03-why-you-should-harvest-garlic-in-may-huw-richards-hero.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/why-you-should-harvest-garlic-in-may-huw-richards/","title":"Why You Should Harvest Garlic in May, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"Growing your own food is a great skill to learn. You can start on a small area to become familiar with the basics. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at the first steps to become more self-sufficient.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards\u0026rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\nFood self-sufficiency: a definition It is the goal to grow your own food you need to eat every day.\nIt is becoming independent and not needing anything from shops.\nIt requires a lot of careful planning and can become overwhelming if you set yourself goals that are too high.\nAlso, you will have to make some sacrifices, not only regarding the food you can actually be self-sufficient with, but also the time you have to grow your own food and what you can grow in your garden.\nIt is about asking oneself the question: what is the ultimate goal of food self-sufficiency?\nHow to start Set small targets to start that are easy to reach and move on to more ambitious ones, without ever going too fast too soon. Otherwise you will crush the goal of self-sufficiency.\nRemember: self-sufficiency doesn\u0026rsquo;t happen overnight.\nThen, self-sufficiency doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean you have to grow food 365 days a year. Instead, try to perform work to reach part-time self-sufficiency.\nGrowing some food for a specific period that you know will be more doable in your situation might just be enough.\nFor example:\nyou can grow salads from April to November and be self-sufficient in salad that period you can grow onions and be self-sufficient through autumn and winter What group crops to start with They are easy to grow and versatile in the kitchen.\nSalads The cut and come again salads are the best (take what you need in leaves while leaving the plant produce).\nFor a couple, you can easily be self-sufficient in salads with a 4 x 4 feet raised bed (equivalent to 1.3 m x 1.3 m, so less than 2 m²) during the growing season.\nTo go further to reach self-sufficiency throughout the year, you can use:\nsome clothes and fleeces to extend the season a small greenhouse or a polytunnel Potatoes If you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough garden space, grow them in 25 to 30 liter containers and start harvesting them from mid-June.\nThey are easy to store through winter. It is done in a dark and cool place.\nOnions It is really easy to grow and to store them.\nThe production could give enough to last from late summer to winter.\nKale You can start kale in mid-March to April and expect to harvest leaves from mid to late June all the way through winter.\nAnd even in the next year, in March, April and May, you will get a lot of flowers shoots that will give you more food.\nThere are a lot of varieties to choose from, so if you are not keen with the curly kale, you can try others, like the red Russian kale.\nAnnual herbs Even if perennial herbs (meaning living for several years) would be easy to pick, we will gain more satisfaction from fresh herbs during the growing season, like:\ndill parsley coriander. How much do I need to grow something Everyone is different so you are the one who can know how much you and your household eat throughout the year.\nFirst, look at the core staples you eat in your case throughout the year.\nThen, estimate:\nhow much you need of a staple per week for example 2 bulbs of garlic per week how long you need that staple: 1 month, 6 months, all year for example 4 months So in the example, that gives us 2 bulbs x 4 months (12 weeks) = 24 plants of garlic.\nBe aware that you will need to think about storage for some food if you want to have it available for longer.\nYou need to take into account the potential failures, so add 20 to 25% to the estimate, so in the example, we will need an extra 6 plants of garlic.\nPersonal tip\nI have started in August 2022 to track the quantity of the food purchases we make.\nIt is easy today to scan a grocery ticket and convert it using an image to text online tool like Online OCR.\nWhile it is not perfect depending on your receipt quality, it helps a lot to build a journal of your purchases week by week and only take a couple of minutes for each ticket.\nAfter a while, you will be able to build a predefined list of produces you buy regularly and you might not need to scan and convert anymore.\nYou can track your purchases using this free Google sheet template over a month or a year (you will need to be patient for a year long tracking).\nPlease feel free to use it as a template. At the end, it will be very quick to identity how much you need from a given crop.\nYou will need to adjust the values in the \u0026ldquo;Constants\u0026rdquo; tab as you go.\nAfter a while, it will be easy to input your purchase if you buy by the season and if you are regular. Contact me if you have questions on how to use the sheet or if you want me to demo it in a video.\nConclusion Test different varieties: some may not work while others can be very successful. Don\u0026rsquo;t beat yourself up if the first try doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite work.\nAlso embrace seasonality: don\u0026rsquo;t try to push against the natural cycle. Tomatoes are a summer crop, while cabbage and squashes are more a winter one.\nWhat benefits do you get from eating out of season?\nyou will have more fresh produce to eat you will have to be more creative on how to use the crops you get. See Huw and Sam\u0026rsquo;s blog for recipes. Look at what is special about every single season and you will become of more self-sufficient.\n","date":"2022-10-02T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-10-02-a-vegetable-garden.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-10/the-simple-way-to-food-self-sufficiency-huw-richards/","title":"The Simple Way to Becoming Self-Sufficient in Food, by Huw Richards"},{"content":"Garlic is a healthy crop to grow for your meal. Huw shares with us his pro tips to harvest plenty of them.\nThanks to Huw Richards for sharing his wisdom and knowledge! I wrote the following notes watching the video published on Huw Richards\u0026rsquo;s channel. You can watch it using this YouTube link.\n3 things to know before growing garlic Garlic exists in 3 categories: softneck, hardneck and elephant Garlic is very hardy crop demanding very little attention after planting The green stem can be consumed! See below\u0026hellip; Elephant garlic It is considered as a perennial crop.\nThere are massive, compared to the regular soft or hardneck garlic.\nHardneck garlic This category tends to have larger cloves and is said to be tastier than softneck garlic.\nHowever the bulbs don\u0026rsquo;t last as long as softneck garlic.\nAlso, hardneck garlic is better suited for cold climates.\nFinally, hardneck garlic produced some beautiful scapes (the top of the stem that will flower and that you need to cut off and eat!)\nSoftneck garlic Even if they produce smaller bulbs, there are more cloves in one head.\nIf you live in a warmer climate, softneck garlic is a good choice.\nPlanting When It starts from mid-October and mid-December.\nAny earlier and you may lose your plants over a really cold winter if they have developed too much.\nPersonal thought\nThat probably means that planting from mid-September (like Charles Dowding suggested) may be only possible under a polytunnel or greenhouse.\nAny later, you risk your bulbs to be underdeveloped.\nSpacing You can plant each clove quite close to each other, between 7 cm to 10 cm.\nAlso, to increase the amount of garlic planted, you can use the diagonal method:\nHow It is easy:\nPrepare the soil with compost.\nUse a large stick. Credits: image taken from The Huw Richard\u0026rsquo;s vlog\nPress down the stick to make a hole 5 cm deep\nSet the clove with the bottom first (where it was attached to the bulb) Credits: image taken from The Huw Richard\u0026rsquo;s vlog and the tip up from where the plant will sprout and grow Credits: image taken from The Huw Richard\u0026rsquo;s vlog\nAlso, plant your garlic in various areas (3-4 locations, if possible) rather than just one place.\nGrowing The most important thing is the plant focuses its energy on the bulb, not the flowering stem (see above)\nBut, mostly, you can forget about garlic for almost 8 months.\nIf there is a period in spring and early summer with no rain, give garlic a heavy soaking.\nHarvest It happens when the bottom 50% of leaves have turned brown (or end of June).\nYou can also enjoy garlic from late April into may. This is called green garlic where you can eat not only the bulb but also the stem.\nGarlic doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be dried to eat it.\nDrying and storing Let garlic dry for a full day under the sun Then move it to dry in the airy place, hanging or lying down on a table, for 4 to 6 weeks After the drying, cut off the stem, leaving 5 cm like shown below Credits: image taken from The Huw Richard\u0026rsquo;s vlog Then store it in a dark, cool but airy place for 9 to 12 months for softneck garlic and 4 to 6 months for hardneck garlic. Other tips To grow more food from the same patch of land, planting beans following harvest is a good idea\nTo store garlic, you can also ferment it with salt and water. Huw Richards talked about a recipe with honey and garlic that can be kept for a year. I\u0026rsquo;ll look into this.\nPersonal experience\nI tried it with carrots and it tastes really good, and amazingly, the spicy side of garlic is done after 1 month of fermentation.\nDiseases White rot White rot affects the Allium family, which the garlic is belonging to.\nIf you do get this, to avoid it, just don\u0026rsquo;t grow garlic in that same place for 3 to 4 years.\nRust This disease is far less of a problem.\nSimply, remove the worst affected leaves. Then when it comes to harvest, remove the outer layer and the garlic will be fine.\nAs long as you take care of the soil, rust goes away. You can also apply lactic acid bacteria using a spray.\n","date":"2022-09-30T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-09-30-a-dry-garlic.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/how-to-grow-garlic-simple-steps-for-huge-yields-huw-richards/","title":"How to Grow Garlic, simple steps for HUGE yields, with Huw Richards"},{"content":"Step by step, Moreno shows how to plant this crop successfully.\nThanks to The Dutch Farmer for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!

Also, it will grow bigger.\nHowever, there is no real solution to rust.\nTypes of garlic There are 2 types:\nhardneck softneck Credits: Gardening Chores\nSoftneck garlic is harvested about 2-3 weeks earlier than hardneck garlic.\nA feature that you may like from the hardneck garlic is the cloves tend to be bigger and therefore easier to peel.\nHow to plant You need to space each plant by 10 cm and row by 30 cm apart.\nPlanting will happen in October on average, but it can happen from mid-September to the end of December. However, the earlier, the better the crops.\nThe steps to plant are quite easy:\nTake the best bulbs from the year before, try to start from one organic bulb in your local supermarket, preferably organic. Use a wood stick to make a 2-3 cm hole. Sow each clove the same way they were growing in the bulb. Cover over and you are done. When to harvest In the UK, the harvest time around the end of June.\nIn my area, in Ardèche, it seems to be the same.\nWhen to harvest garlic has nothing to do with how yellow the leaves are. At least half the leaves should still be green unless a severe case of rust has attacked the plants.\nWhat you want to feel around the bulb are the protrusions (e.g., where the cloves are forming). This is when the garlic is mature. You can feel this by uncovering the top of the garlic.\nIf you leave the garlic too long, you will get the following:\nHow to harvest Take the garlic out by pulling it gently while digging it out gently to keep the stem and / or the remaining leaves. Keeping the stem will help conserving it longer. Cut the roots while fresh. Peel out the first outer skin because it is a lot easier How to store garlic At first, right after harvest, you can leave quite a bite of stem to help the garlic finish ripening.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t leave garlic under the direct sun too long. Two days is enough to dry the outer skin, otherwise, it can start deteriorating. Then, put it under cover to dry some more for about 20 days, with enough air.\n","date":"2022-09-28T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-09-22-supermarket-garlic-for-seed-charles-dowding-hero.webp","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/grow-garlic-easy-with-no-dig-tips-for-harvest-charles-dowding/","title":"Grow garlic, an easy crop with no dig, hard or softneck, and tips for harvest, by Charles Dowding"},{"content":"Credits: George Hodan on publicdomainpictures.net\nThanks to Charles Dowding for sharing his wisdom and knowledge!

The best is to use term that the enduser understand.\nPoint 4: Seek feedback through iteration Feedback is key to know if your product is doing what the customer asked for.\nIterating several times will help to ease the bug hunt.\nIt is a good idea to set up a little form or list of things you want to get from feedback, so that the person testing doesn\u0026rsquo;t just say to you:\nIt doesn\u0026rsquo;t work\u0026hellip;\nGuide the tester and the end user with hints of what you need to solve an anomaly.\nPoint 5: Trace the system in execution to troubleshoot it efficiently The worse thing is to deploy a product that you think works as intended, but, when the customer puts his hands on it, everything breaks.\nBe sure to trace the important data or processes that you would need to troubleshoot a problem. Usually, it is done in the development process, because you will debug your app or you will need information to solve bugs you find.\nWhere you would set breakpoints is probably a good place to put a trace!\nPlease leave your thoughts on Twitter.\nPhoto by Brett Jordan on Unsplash\n","date":"2022-09-08T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/2022-09-08-what-can-you-teach-about-problem-solving.jpg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2022-09/what-can-you-teach-about-problem-solving/","title":"What can you teach about problem solving to a developer"},{"content":"Seven years ago, we bought our house and the property is about 4000 m², on a very rocky terrace (“AOC Saint Joseph” in Ardèche).\nIt wasn’t very inviting for planting anything (we tried and keep trying with the “No Dig” method by Charles Dowding and Damien Dekarz’s advice, in France). However, it seemed exploitable for putting up some photovoltaic panels.\nNotice\nThis article was published originally in French in June 2022. It has been translated, but the units and images with text remain in French as it’s difficult to get them in English language.\nWe heat our domestic hot water in off-peak hours. It’s a 200-liter-big water tank with 10 cm of raw sheep’s wool layer that we added the first winter, because it’s in the garage, temperatures can go as low as 8° C. I know we could do it differently, but we don’t have anywhere else to put it.\nThis insulation let us reduce our consumption from 12 to 13kWh to heat the water to 8–10 kWh for one day, with equivalent hot water consumption.\nWhy A PV System? Measuring Our Consumption I’m pretty careful about electricity consumption and I agree with those who advocate energy sobriety (french article) to reduce our impact on the environment.\nI made an estimate of our consumption in 2016, listing each electrified item, because, for me, knowing the household’s consumption and the breakdown on equipment is the first step towards greater efficiency and awareness about energy usage. I recently took notes (french article) on an interview between Rémi chez “Nos pieds sur terre” and Brian, of “l’Archipelle” which validates this first step.\nI had estimated 2900 kWh over 1 year. You can consult this table for details and feel free to copy the Google Sheets for your case.\nYou can see, for example, that I had estimated the hot water production to take 30% of the total estimate.\nNB: the table excludes the oven, dishwasher and air purifier (Murprotec CTA5) installed in 2018.\nI also closely monitored our consumption with:\na daily reading on the EDF digital meter for several years, then more recently, thanks to Linky, a weekly reading, to know our passive consumption (e.g., how much does the house need as a minimum?) and our day and night consumption, and in the case of water heaters, specific metering from November 2019 after buying an old digital meter from EDF.

We’re on the first third of a 300-meter-high hill.\nWhy Only Build In 2022? My prerequisites for the project were:\nto respect a maximum budget of 2,000 euros, with reuse of panels to reduce costs and for environmental reasons. not to inject the unused production onto the grid, i.e., to consume as much as possible. to be profitable before replacing sensitive elements (inverter in particular). So I read a lot on the subject (for ex. a French photovoltaic forum) and simulated the cost on the various web shops selling PV equipment, but I didn’t go for it because of:\nthe cost of the equipment the fact that companies only sell setups of 3kWp at prices ranging from 7,000 to 15,000 euros. Also, the fact that the installation couldn’t be carried out on the roof of the house was blocking me. I wanted to avoid giving away the electricity not consumed (injected into the grid) to companies (Enedis, Engie, etc.) who sell it to us at increasingly high prices. In France, it’s mandatory to install on a roof to sell the production from PV modules.\nIn May 2022, the grid buys the electricity at 6 to 10 cents whereas it sells it to me for between 17 and 22 centimes (my night-day tariff with Engie in May 2022).\nAt the end of 2021, I receive an email on my “Leboncoin” alert entitled “photovoltaic panels” (“Leboncoin” is like “Craiglist”). It was from a craftsman promoting his services to use the photovoltaic solution for hot water production at more or less 1000 euros. I said to myself: “This is within my budget and the craftsman I was looking for!”\nPresentation Of The Installation After some very interesting discussions with the SolaireEthic craftsman (see his very interesting website), we decided on the following solution:\n1 APSystems QS1 microinverter (4 MPPT). 1 underground 6 mm² AC line 120 m long from the target terrace on the property to the house (50 cm from the main switchboard in the house). The overall distance is due to the location of the terrace. 8 panels of 190 Wp recycled (7–8 years old), i.e. 1520 Wp If we take into account the 0.3% reduction in production, we’re looking at between 1484 and 1488 Wp. The 0.3% value comes from the study carried out since 1992 in Savoie (I don’t have the link), but quoted in my note-taking (§ “Dimensioning photovoltaic panels”) (french article). I then:\nDug the trench (not easy with rocky soil, very cold temperatures, between December 2022 and January 2023, and a 25-meter difference in altitude between the terrace and the house). Ordered the self-consumption optimization kit from Robin Emley (now retired), assembled by Le Profes’Solaire (unfortunately, he has stopped his assembly service, but he still seems to offer welding). Here is the result:\nWhat Do The Figures Say After 2 Months? From April 1 to May 31, we measured the following:\nmonth produced (kWh) self-consumed (kWh) injected into the grid (kWh) April 160.6 147.6 13 May 210.4 186.4 24 So we have a good consumption of production (\u0026gt; 90%). There would be less injection if:\nI’d connected the solar router’s CT the right way, which I didn’t do until April 4! It measures the direction of electricity. If it goes to the grid, it activates the solar router. We had a storage system to either: consume at night consume later If we compare the same data from commissioning on March 27 to April 4, we see:\nproduced (kWh) self-consumed (kWh) fed into the grid (kWh) stored (kWh) 30.8 12.8 18 It gives a 40% of production consumption.\nBTW, the reason why I chose not to make a deal with the grid provider is that you can’t resell when the panels are installed on the ground. See § “What are the conditions for selling solar electricity to EDF?” on this article in french.\nWhat Are My Observations? Solar Router From Robin Emley It’s very efficient.\nI’ve observed that you inject about 100Wh into the grid with the solar router, or 1 kWh every 10 days, when we produce 6 to 7 kWh per day. This is very marginal and acceptable.\nOn the other hand, the mechanical meters I’ve fitted to the router outputs don’t allow you to count kWh precisely. It seems under-measured. In fact, the solar router count doesn’t match with those mechanical meters.\nPerhaps lowering the water heater resistance so that “power produced = power used” would make the measurements more accurate.\nIndeed, depending on the power of the appliance, there was less metering because of the intermittence of the current sent by the router.\nFor example, with a 600 W dehydrator, the count is more accurate.\nDomestic Hot Water We’ve set the water heater thermostat to 4 over 5 when heating via solar instead of 3 over 5 when heating during off-peak hours.\nOn a sunny day, the sun heats more than enough for the day.\nOn a gray day, we manage to maintain the temperature.\nIf the weather was worse, there would be 2 days of hot water in stock after a fine day. Of course, this varies according to hot water use.\nI’ve considered installing a second 200-liter hot water tank to store solar-generated hot water.\nHowever, it’s an investment of 700 to 800 euros and the need isn’t really there, as we don’t really need 400 liters of hot water, especially during the summer. Plus, we only welcome 2 or 3 extra people very rarely during the year.\nManagement Problem Between The Router Power Supply And The Night-Day Contactor As shown in the installation diagram above, I’ve set up the two water heater power supplies in parallel. However, I should have a switch that controls the power source next to the router rather than doing it manually in the garage.\nThere’s also some strange behavior on the efficiency of the night/day contactor. It doesn’t receive the signal we’re in night mode or, maybe, the signal from the grid is missing? I don’t know whether it’s a bad connection or a network problem. In fact, before Linky was installed, we’d had inconsistencies where the contactor was active during the day while it was set in Auto mode..\nDaily Consumption With Presence We can clearly see the refrigerator cycling on and off, and the peak represents the dishwasher running between midnight and 3 a.m.\nDaily Consumption In Our Absence In February 2022, we were away for 5 weeks. The average daily consumption was 2.5 kWh.\nIn April 2022, we were away for a few days. The average daily consumption dropped to 0.7 kWh, i.e. -72%. Not bad!\nWhat’s Next? I’m going to:\nTry to estimate from the PVG reports and our setup how long it will take to make the installation profitable. Provide feedback in October, e.g., 6 months after commissioning. Talk to Rémi at “Nos pieds sur terre” about making our installation cost-effective.

I used to use only console.log, playing the speech synthesis, really nailing the array methods down, listening the keyboard strokes to perform cool stuff, replicating the Stripe website navigation (I want to finish the keyboard navigation as Wes doesn\u0026rsquo;t cover that), catching mouse and touch events to interact with the UI… I think taking his ES6 course or any other course on Modern JavaScript will be a good help prior to taking this 30 days challenge.\nCheck out my exercise solutions live here.\nThe Missing bits It would have been great if Wes had summarized the instructions for each challenge.\nI tried to write them down at the beginning of each course so I could have a go on my own before watching / checking the solution.\nSomething, you have to view the render of the solution to get those requirements right.\nAlso, a few accessibility tricks using JavaScript would be good to help the new web developers be really aware of that end-user need.\nSummary Going through the entire course took me 47h in total.\nThanks Wes for creating this awesome month-long challenge.

Read on to the missing bits to know more.\nThe Missing bits The course is old (released in 2017) and would need a little update, especially in lesson 13 where we learn to use webpack and babel. Maybe a course could be built about that\u0026hellip;\nIt might need a refresher, especially to help the people who are really new to npm. Or an advice would be to practice npm.\nWhat I did is stick to the exact same npm package versions that Wes used so that I would get the same result.\nIf you follow along, you will find out that installing the latest packages will not work since the courses doesn’t cover the breaking change in the webpack and babel packages.\nNo matter what, the community is there to help.\nAlso, there are exercises and they are good but the course would be really great if the student could have a clear understanding of use cases to use such or such features.\nMaybe a small project with, for each stage, a focus on each feature studied would have been a great way to practice the feature. That’s what is done in the Responsive Web Design Bootcamp course over at Scrimba.\nSummary Going through the entire course took me 15 hours.\nI had taken the “Mobile Web Specialist” nanodegree at Udacity where I learned mainly the service worker technology and the prerequisite was to learn about ES6 before diving into the more complex PWA topic.\nYou can read my courses notes on the dedicated repository.

It seems that in Lyon, the air quality has never been so good than now!\n(source)\n(source)\n(source)\n(source)\nIs that a surprise? To me, if you tell people to stay home, not only you will reduce the amount of time spent in the car (air pollution) which generate a lot of noise from the occasional horns and just the fact of driving (noise pollution). So, no it is not a surprise. In my neighborhood, we can hear the different (and we don’t live in a big city).\nAre people aware of the change? It depends on what they are doing. Yes, lockdown means you stay home. Period. Those in cities might not have a balcony, nor a private garden. So they might not even breathe the renewed, clean air from outside (you should if you are not). If most of the population doesn’t become aware of the benefits of reduced use of gasoline-powered transportation, what lessons are we going to learn about the current situation? That the media are very much hyped about the coronavirus? That you might die from it?\nHave you wondered about what really kills people for years? In There’s an Epidemic That’s a Bigger Threat Than the Coronavirus, Dr. David L. Katz reminds us that diet-related diseases kill thousands every year.\nPoor overall diet quality is the single leading cause of premature death in the United States today, causing an estimated 500,000 or so deaths each year.\nDid you know that? Do you think it is a fad? If so, why? I have been improving my diet for the past 10 years now and, not only did I lose a significant amount of weight, but also I learn to pick better sources: I choose the organic products rather the regular ones when it is something that is not produced in my area. I purchase food from local farmer markets, which I admit are numerous in the Rhone Valley. I refrain from purchasing goods in supermarkets whenever possible.\nThe result from my own experience: a couple of running nose and coughing per year. However, I cannot guarantee that perfect diet (what is it in the first place?) will immune you from Coronavirus but it can help. Do you allow for the possibility that it can? Now, I might be lashed on for the following but I want to get out: what about smoking or substance abuse? Are you going to tell me that it doesn’t: Cause more death every year than Coronavirus? Cause economic stress on our society because of the expensive cancer treatments? Numb the mind in a way that we can’t feel what’s around us and loose the contact with the people and the nature? Maybe, before complaining about how the governments are going to ask us to give to climb back the economic ladder, what can YOU do to reduce the economic and health stress in your life?\nWhat can we do after Coronavirus? Wake up? Stop dreaming? Take care of what you have been given? It is simpler than we think. Pause and look around you. Some people take a car to go to work when they live 3 kilometers from work. Why? Some people eat sugar-loaded food that they know (because they tell me) is bad for them. Why? Because we have to die from something? Well, is that case, I leave the question hanging: is Coronavirus that bad?\n","date":"2020-03-25T00:00:00Z","image":"https://iamjeremie.me/images/do-we-need-the-coronavirus-hero.jpeg","permalink":"https://iamjeremie.me/post/2020-03-25-do-we-need-the-covid-to-reduce-our-impact-on-nature/","title":"Do we need the coronavirus to reduce our impact on our environment?"},{"content":"Support me by reading the story on Medium!\nTake the time for your spouse.\nTake the time for your children.\nTake the time for you.\nBalance all that and be satisfied that what you get is what you get.\nThink about what you can do with a very focused mind, not going left or right when you are pulled in those directions.\nNo, look in front of you and work towards that goal.\nYes you see it, it is always in sight.

You can interact with the video as you go and edit the code the teacher typing. Cool, uh?\nEven better, you can save your edits to the code so that you can follow along the version of the teacher and go back to your version (e.g. it is kinda of a branch like in Git) when you pause the video.\nThis is something I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen anywhere else (I have done course on Udemy and Audacity) and this tops all of them.\nI recommend having a try by signing up. Pick a free course and see it for yourself.\nWho Kevin Powell is the teacher. His curriculum is impressive and yet, I didn\u0026rsquo;t know him before the course.\nThroughout the course, you will find out that his voice is clear and his words are accurate to explain the concept at hand.\nI am experienced in the CSS and HTML technologies, having worked in the Web sphere since 2009. So I actually went 1.4x time the normal speed throughout the course ;)\nStill, when I was stuck in a point, Kevin\u0026rsquo;s examples made it clear and I really feel like I saved into my programming toolkit the skills taught by him to really be able to apply it in the real-life scenarios.\nThe Good Let\u0026rsquo;s now review the course: I thought I knew my topic… How wrong was I!\nFirst, typography: I knew that using relative units as better than fixed units. Well, how thankful was I to learn exactly when to use each unit.\nFor example, rem is the recommended units for font-size while em is the unit we should prefer to px.\nSecond, Flexbox: who hasn\u0026rsquo;t used float in the last 10 years? who wasn\u0026rsquo;t tired of it and used Bootstrap to create \u0026ldquo;grid-like\u0026rdquo; layout that didn\u0026rsquo;t break?\nYes, but even with Bootstrap, and maybe I wasn\u0026rsquo;t using it properly, I feel like I was replacing the CSS hell with the HTML hell. What I mean by that is that the markup felt much more dense or decorative than for the purpose of the layout. You know the \u0026ldquo;Callback hell\u0026rdquo; in JavaScript, well I felt the \u0026ldquo;\u0026lt;\\div\u0026gt; hell\u0026rdquo; with Bootstrap.\nNote: I have use Bootstrap 4 over the past year for work (not that I chose it) and I think the version 4 has helped a lot to solve the version 3 issues.\nI think that the content and project of the course are well made and I was actually pushed to test more as Kevin always emphasized.\nFor example, I made this utility to visually see the result of the properties flex-directions, align-items and justify-contents.\nThird, CSS grid: it was the one topic I was, kind of, apprehending. I started Wesbos\u0026rsquo;s course but I didn\u0026rsquo;t finish it. I\u0026rsquo;m not saying it is because Wes but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t motivated enough.\nWith Kevin, I was and I not only learned a lot of cool tricks to build a template layout but also I learned to use it in ways that I didn\u0026rsquo;t expect.\nNow, it is full-speed ahead with CSS Grid and Flexbox, the vanilla style when it is possible.\nThe Bad The main element missing, in my opinion, in the course is a more detailed use of web responsive images.\nIn my opinion, images are not only about \u0026lsquo;width: 100%\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;object: fit\u0026rsquo; ;)\nWhat about \u0026lsquo;scrset\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;sizes\u0026rsquo;?\nHow and when to use them?\nI know that those attributes are not supported with IE and even not with Edge 14 and lower, but I think it is an important part of the web and images will always be displayed on websites :)\nAdding this missing bit would make the course more complete.\nImages are a big part of the web space. Even on Medium.com, you can see a lot of images.\nSummary I recommended the course for anyone who is self-taught.\nWhy? Because, in fact, the course is done well and you can learn from others.\nSometimes, especially with fundamentals like CSS and HTML, learning it wrong may be hard to unlearn later (it depends on your mindset and if you are willing to learn from others).\nPersonally, I measure the value of this course by learning the skills to build a website without any CSS framework (ok, except Font Awesome, but I\u0026rsquo;m looking to build that from scratch) like Bootstrap or Foundation (I know the former only).\nGoing through the entire course took me :\n2.65 hours for module 1 7.77 hours for module 2 7.70 hours for module 3 5.53 hours for module 4 5.60 hours for module 5 and finally a good 14 hours for module 6. So I took me 43.25 hours to complete the course and really increase my skills. That\u0026rsquo;s only 4 and a half weeks if you work 2 hours per weekday on it. On the final project, I did try my best not to watch Kevin\u0026rsquo;s solution, hence the greater amount of time spent. When I got stuck (ex: the hero image, the main grid trick, the mobile menu), I was watching the videos to be inspired but then, his solution is different than my final render.\nNow, before moving to JavaScript or ReactJS or Vue or UI courses, I’d like to apply my skills to undo all the Bootstrap 3 templates I used on my existing projects and see if I can achieve the same look and feel with no HTML template and css framework (except Font Awesome.\nI am certain I can :)\nMy study website is hosted powered by the awesome Netlify.\nThanks Kevin.
