I was battling with an issue after creating my first `TOML` snippet to use in Visual Studio Code. Here is why it‚Äôs didn‚Äôt work!

## The Snippet

I built this snippet to add a redirect to my `netlify.toml` file:

```toml
{
  "Add redirect TOML": {
    "scope": "toml",
    "prefix": "add netlify redirect",
    "body": [
      "[[redirects]]",
      "from = \"$1\"",
      "to = \"$2\"",
      "status = 301",
      "force = true",
    ],
    "description": "add a redirect handled by Netlify",
  },
}
```

## The Issue

When I tried to use it my `netlify.toml` file, `add netlify redirect` wouldn‚Äôt show up‚Ä¶ ü§î

Why? The reason is on this screen. Do you see it?

![Issue demonstrated](issue-demonstrated.png)

Yes, the ‚ÄúPlain Text‚Äù at the bottom. Since I scoped the snippet to work on `toml` code, it makes sense that it doesn‚Äôt show up‚Ä¶ The snippet doesn‚Äôt specify ‚ÄúPlain text‚Äù in its scope.

## The Fix

You simply need to install the ‚ÄúTOML Language Support‚Äù extension. Once you enabled the extension, you can use the snippet in `netlify.toml`!

You can see the file association works:

And the snippet works:

## Conclusion

Though Visual Studio Code comes with good file associations,I encountered the issue for the first time.

So, if you‚Äôre like me and you notice a snippet not working, think about looking at the bottom right‚Ä¶ üòÅ
