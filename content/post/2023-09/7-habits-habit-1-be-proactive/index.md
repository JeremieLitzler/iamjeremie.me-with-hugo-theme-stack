## What does it mean

How we act and how we respond is our responsibility.

Frankl Victor was a jew who experienced attrocities in the death camps of the Nazi's regime.

Yet, he realized one fundamental principle: he could decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him.

> Between stimulus and response, a man has the freedom to choose.
>
> ~ Stephen R. Covey

This means that our behavior is function of our decision, not the condition we are in.

Look at the word "_Responsibility_": you could split into "_Response_" and "_Ability_".

That means we should not blame circumstances, conditions and conditionning.

## How to be proactive

Use values, not the feelings to respond to a situation.

<!-- Insert "Freedom to choose" diagram of p79 -->

To become proactive, we must subordinate an impulse to a value instead of a feeling.

For example, can I say:

> I am what I am today because of the choices I made yesterday.
>
> If so, I choose otherwise!

### Take initiative

On pages 82 to 85, we pick up that two letters: R & I.

It stands for _Resourcefulness_ and _Initiative_. It means that we need to adapt to others, especially those who are emotionnally dependent.

## Act or be acted up

Being proactive, it is to be responsible and to take responsibility to act.

The diffence between proactivity and positive thinking is that the former is facing reality and act upon it.

## Listen to your language

Choose proactive language and ask yourself: am I reactive in the way I talk?

| Reactive language         | Proactive language                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| There's nothing I can do. | Let's look at our alternatives.        |
| That's just the way I am. | I can choose a different approach.     |
| He makes me so sad.       | I control my own feelings.             |
| They won't allow that.    | I can create an effective presentation |
| I have to do that.        | I will choose an appropriate response. |
| I can't...                | I choose...                            |
| I must...                 | I prefer...                            |
| If only...                | I will...                              |

For example, the concept of love:

- for reactive people, it is a feeling.
- for proactive people, it is a verb.

Where do you fall into?

Personally, I fall into the reactive pool more often than I'd like.
