In 2023, the weather was significantly wetter than 2022.

By the end of the month, the seven 1000-liters tanks were full of rain water and very little was used to water the garden.

The thick layer of autumn leaves kept the moisture well for the roots of the garlic, snow peas and broad beans.

However, the drawback was that the climbing beans were all eaten by the slugs :(
