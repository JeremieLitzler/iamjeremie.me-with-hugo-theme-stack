To build this SQL Statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM event
WHERE
status IN ('NEW', 'TODO') AND
confirmed_at IS NULL AND
created_at <= p_cutoff_datetime
```

You shouldn‚Äôt declare your SQLAlchemy query as follows:

```python
            query = session.query(EventEntity).filter(
                    EventEntity.status.in_(statuses),
                    EventEntity.confirmed_at == None,
                    EventEntity.created_at <= cutoff_datetime
            )
```

It will output the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM event
WHERE
0 != 1 -- ü§î
```

The `0 != 1` is SQLAlchemy‚Äôs way of creating a condition that always returns false.

Instead, use SQLAlchemy like this, wrapping your conditions with the `_and` operator :

```python
            from sqlalchemy import and_

            query = session.query(EventEntity).filter(
                and_(
                    EventEntity.status.in_(statuses),
                    EventEntity.confirmed_at == None,
                    EventEntity.created_at <= cutoff_datetime
                )
            )
```

That‚Äôs it for this one!
